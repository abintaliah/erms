# Notifications and In-App Messaging — Specification

**Status:** Approved
**Approved:** 2 October 2026
**Project:** ERMS / Wathiq  
**Prepared:** 30 September 2026  
**Revision:** 1.20 — editorial clarification; approved behavior unchanged

## 1. Purpose

This specification defines Wathiq's in-app notifications and messaging
subsystem. Wathiq can send system notifications, and an authorized user can
send a message to one or more other users. Recipients do not need to be online
when a message is sent.

The send transaction stores the message and each recipient's Inbox entry
together. After it commits, a real-time event can alert connected clients.
The event interface is independent of the frontend: NiceGUI may show a toast,
while a future Flutter application may show an in-app banner.

The live connection is an optimization, not the message store and not proof of
delivery. A temporary network failure, closed client, or restarted application
must not lose a committed message.

### 1.1 Non-normative user-interface mockup

The repository includes a [clickable user-to-user messaging
mockup](../docs/mockups/wathiq-user-messaging.html) covering Inbox, Outbox,
Drafts, Compose, message reading, replies, forwarding, follow-ups, recipient
selection, action completion, and action amendments.

The mockup is a design and review aid only. It does not create an API contract,
authorize behavior, or override this specification. If the mockup and this
specification differ, this specification is authoritative. Production user
interfaces must also comply with the design language, internationalization,
accessibility, authorization, performance, and frontend-specific requirements
applicable to that implementation.

### 1.2 How to read this specification

For product behavior, start with the scope and terms in sections 2–3, the core
rules in section 4, and the user experience in section 6. MSG-020 explains
expiry, mailbox restoration, and whole-conversation purge.

For implementation, use the database model in section 7, transactions in
section 8, real-time architecture in section 9, and API responsibilities in
section 10. Sections 11–13 cover operations, security, internationalization,
and accessibility. Section 14 provides acceptance criteria; section 16 assigns
implementation and verification to phases. Read the detailed requirements
alongside those criteria; a short acceptance statement does not replace them.

“Shall” and “must” express requirements. “May” permits an option; it does not
require it. Examples explain a rule without adding a new requirement. The UI
mockup and section 15's channel comparison are explanatory. Requirement IDs,
field names, privilege codes, and acceptance IDs provide stable references
for implementation and verification.

## 2. Scope

This subsystem includes:

- system notifications addressed to users;
- messages sent by one user to one or more users;
- user, Wathiq-role, organizational-unit, and synthetic Everyone recipient selectors;
- `To` and `Cc` recipients;
- one independently identifiable recipient copy per addressee;
- inbox, unread state, message reading, and read receipts;
- a human sender's Outbox containing previously sent messages;
- private saved message drafts;
- a privilege-gated operational Monitor page;
- replies and Inbox forwards linked to an earlier recipient copy, plus Outbox
  forwards and follow-ups linked to an earlier sent envelope;
- rich-text message bodies;
- links to Wathiq resources;
- priority and action-required indicators;
- optional action due dates, reply-based completion acknowledgments, and late
  indicators;
- a frontend-neutral near-real-time event interface for connected clients;
- NiceGUI toast notification as one presentation adapter;
- durable catch-up after disconnection or application restart; and
- capture of an authorized sent or received message and its linked
  reply/forward/follow-up chain as a Wathiq record through the existing record-draft
  workflow.

This subsystem does not include:

- email, SMS, mobile push notifications, or any other external delivery
  channel;
- attachments or embedded copies of Wathiq resources;
- group conversations, chat rooms, presence, or typing indicators;
- automatic authority to view a linked Wathiq resource;
- action assignment, instructions, progress stages, escalation, reassignment,
  approval, or another action-management workflow; or
- a guarantee that a person has understood or acted upon a message.

## 3. Terms

**Message envelope** means the parent object created by one send operation. It
holds the fields that are identical for every recipient, and its related rows
hold the original recipient selections and resource links.

**Send-level message data** means the parts of a sent message that belong to the
whole send and therefore are stored once rather than copied into every
recipient's Inbox row. They are the sender snapshot, subject, priority, security
level, body, message-level flags, relationship references, original recipient
selectors, expanded addressee snapshots, and structured resource links. They do
not include recipient-specific mailbox sequence, read time, action-completion
state, or deletion state.

**Recipient selector** means a user, role, organizational unit, or synthetic Everyone audience chosen in
`To` or `Cc`. **Expansion** resolves those choices to eligible individual
users. An **addressee** is one of those resolved users. Several selectors may
resolve to the same user, who still receives only one copy.

**Recipient copy**, also called a **delivery**, means the stored Inbox entry
for one `To` or `Cc` recipient. It has its own globally unique ID and read
state, but refers to the envelope's shared content rather than duplicating it.
**Fan-out** means creating one such delivery for each distinct addressee.

**Mailbox entry** means one user's access to a message through their Inbox or
Outbox. Inbox entries use delivery rows; the sender's Outbox entry uses the
envelope. Deleting one entry does not delete shared content or another user's
entry. “Mailbox reference” elsewhere in this specification has this meaning.

**Immutable** means ordinary operations cannot rewrite the stored value or
row. It does not mean the data is kept forever: the specified lifecycle may
still delete it. Action amendments add history without rewriting an original
message; retention-group purge deletes that history with the group.

**Snapshot** means a value saved as it was at the time of the operation, such
as a sender's name at send time. Later directory or configuration changes do
not rewrite that value. Current authorization is still checked separately.

**Expiry** is the end of a message's own configured retention period.
**Restoration period** is the time during which a deleted Inbox or Outbox entry
can be restored. **Purge** is permanent database deletion. These are distinct
steps, governed by MSG-020; none describes recovery of a deleted user account.
Drafts have their separate expiry and restoration rules in MSG-016.

**Retention group** means all sent messages connected by replies, forwards,
follow-ups, or action-amendment notices, including every branch. They are kept
and purged together under MSG-020. Membership does not grant access to other
messages or participants.

**Linked earlier messages** means the messages reachable by following a
selected message's references back to their sources. This is the chain used
for linked-message reading and record capture. It is not the entire retention
group, which can also contain later messages and other branches.

**Idempotency** means that retrying the same operation with the same key does
not perform it twice. A **request receipt** is the small operation record used
to enforce that rule; it is unrelated to a recipient's read receipt. Section 8
defines the response before and after the result messages are purged.

**System message** means an envelope created by an approved Wathiq process
rather than by a person. Its displayed sender name is `system`.

**Live signal** means a transient instruction to a connected client to refresh
or display a newly committed recipient copy. A live signal is not the message
itself and is not durable delivery.

**Real-time gateway** means an authenticated backend API connection that emits
live signals to a client or frontend adapter. The gateway is independent of
NiceGUI and may use a documented WebSocket or server-sent-event protocol.

**Database notification channel** means PostgreSQL `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` used to
tell every real-time gateway instance that a committed delivery may be
available. The notification is a transient wake-up signal, not the durable
message store.

**Read receipt** means the sender-visible fact that a specified recipient copy
was first marked as read. It is available only when the sender requested read
receipts.

**System-message language variant** means one immutable rendered subject/body
pair for a registered enabled language, produced from the same system event,
configuration version, and typed context as every other language variant of
that envelope.

## 4. Core rules

### MSG-001 — In-app only

The subsystem shall not depend on email or another external delivery system.
A message is delivered to the user's Wathiq inbox.

### MSG-002 — Allowed senders

Wathiq may send a system message to a user. An authenticated person user may
send a user message to one or more users only when they have the
`messaging.user_messages.exchange` global privilege.

A user message shall store the sender's user ID and their name at send time. A
system message has no sending user ID and stores the sender-name snapshot
`system`. Later changes to a user's name or deletion of a user must not rewrite
the historical sender name.

### MSG-003 — Required message fields

For an authorized reader, each recipient copy shall expose the following
fields. MSG-014 and section 6.2 define what to show when clearance is insufficient:

- its globally unique ID;
- sender name;
- subject;
- priority;
- security level, when currently authorized for the viewer;
- rich-text body;
- whether action is required;
- action due date and the viewer's applicable derived action status;
- whether the copy has been read;
- the original `To` recipient selectors;
- the original `Cc` recipient selectors;
- when it was sent; and
- whether a read receipt was requested.

`is_read` is recipient-specific. It shall be derived from whether the recipient
copy has a `read_at` timestamp rather than maintained as an independent boolean
that could disagree with that timestamp.

### MSG-004 — Addressing

A send operation shall contain at least one `To` recipient. It may contain
multiple distinct `To` recipients and multiple distinct `Cc` recipients.

The same user shall not occur more than once in one envelope and shall not be
both a `To` and a `Cc` recipient. Recipient membership and displayed recipient
names shall be snapshotted at send time.

A sender cannot address their own user account. Inactive or suspended users
shall not be returned by recipient search, accepted as direct selectors, or
included by role or organizational-unit expansion.

A human user lacking `messaging.user_messages.exchange` shall not be returned
or accepted as a recipient for a human-authored message. This restriction does
not prevent registered backend producers from delivering system messages.

By default, one send allows at most 100 selectors across `To` and `Cc`
combined, and at most 2,000 distinct users after expansion. If either limit is
exceeded, the API rejects the whole send and creates no message or deliveries.
It must not silently shorten the recipient list.
These are deployment configuration values read from validated environment
variables. Values must be positive, changing them requires an application
restart, and increasing them requires transaction, notification-volume, and UI
performance testing. The effective values shall be exposed in the compose
capabilities response so clients can explain a limit before final send.

### MSG-005 — Role and organizational-unit recipients

The sender may place one or more Wathiq roles or organizational units in `To`
or `Cc`, in addition to selecting individual users.

A role selector must identify an effectively active role. It expands at send
time to every active person user who currently has that role as an effective
role under Wathiq's existing effective-role rules. This includes assignment
validity, user status, role status, and the status of the role's owning
organizational unit and its ancestors.

For a human-authored message, role and organizational-unit expansion includes
only users who currently have `messaging.user_messages.exchange` through an
effective role. System-message audience expansion does not require that
privilege.

An organizational-unit selector must identify an active organizational unit.
It expands at send time to every active person user who currently has at least
one effective role directly owned by that organizational unit. It does not
implicitly include users whose effective roles belong only to descendant
organizational units; a descendant unit must be selected separately.

Expansion uses one database transaction snapshot. Later changes to users,
assignments, roles, or organizational units do not add or remove recipients
from an already-sent message.

The original selectors and their names at send time become the immutable `To`
and `Cc` headers. The resolved users form the sender's fixed recipient list for
delivery and receipt status. A recipient does not gain permission to enumerate
every expanded user merely because they received the message.

If several selectors resolve to the same user, that user receives one copy.
If the user appears in both `To` and `Cc`, `To` takes precedence. Role and
organizational-unit expansion excludes the human sender before removing
duplicates and checking the recipient limit. If a selector resolves to no
eligible user, the whole send fails without creating an envelope or delivery.

### MSG-005A — Shared selector components

Within each frontend implementation, every messaging interface that selects a
user, role, organizational unit, or security level shall reuse the corresponding
selector component already used elsewhere in that same frontend. Thus WebUI
messaging reuses the established WebUI selectors, while a Flutter messaging UI
reuses the selectors established by the Flutter application. This applies to
Compose, Drafts, recipient validation, Notification Administration audiences,
controlled test sends, filters, and any later messaging interface that presents
one of these entity selectors.

WebUI and Flutter do not have to share UI code, widgets, packages, or rendering
technology. Each reuses its own components. Both use the same messaging APIs
and server-enforced rules.

The messaging subsystem shall not introduce a messaging-only user selector,
role selector, organizational-unit selector, or security-level selector, nor
copy the shared component's search, pagination, display, accessibility, RTL, or
selection behavior into a separate implementation. Messaging may configure the
shared components for single or multiple selection, `To` or `Cc` placement,
bounded search, retained selected values, and messaging-specific eligibility or
validation explanations.

If an established selector in that frontend lacks a capability required by this
specification, that capability shall be added to that frontend's shared
component through a general reusable interface and verified against its
existing consumers. It shall not be solved by creating or maintaining a
messaging-specific fork within that frontend. Reuse of a UI component does not
replace server-side messaging authorization,
clearance, activity, privilege, expansion, deduplication, or send-time
validation.

The human message composer always displays separate multiple-recipient `To`
and `Cc` fields. Selecting a result adds it directly to that field; users do not
choose an entity type or press a separate Add button. After at least two typed
characters, shared debounced typeahead searches users, roles and organizational
units together. Matching is case-insensitive against canonical names and
descriptions, their translations in enabled supported languages, role and unit
codes, user external IDs (the existing user identifier field), and user email
addresses. Results show the localized name and entity type. Each type is searched
in bounded server pages; users can refine their query for further matches.
Selected values remain visible as removable chips when the query changes and
when a draft is reopened.

For users with the existing `organization.browse` privilege, a Browse
organization structure action below each address field opens the shared,
lazily paged organizational browser. It navigates units, roles and users
and can select any eligible entity into that field. Messaging eligibility is
checked when selected and again at send time. Existing recipient limits, To
precedence, expansion and draft behavior remain authoritative.

### MSG-005B — Organization-wide Everyone recipient

Human messages may select **Everyone** in To or Cc. This is a synthetic
messaging audience, not a role row or an organizational-unit subtree. It uses
the familiar Everyone name without changing Everyone's ACL semantics.

- Everyone in To is the sole selector across both To and Cc. Selecting it
  replaces existing selections; removing it restores ordinary selection.
- Everyone in Cc is the sole Cc selector. Ordinary users, roles and organizational
  units may still be selected in To. Selecting it replaces other Cc selections.
- Everyone in Cc still requires at least one ordinary To selector before sending.
- Selecting Everyone in either field does not disable resource search or
  attachment. Users may link records and aggregations, including organization-wide
  circulars, under the existing resource authorization and attachment-limit rules.
- Resolve Everyone at send time to all eligible active person accounts across
  the organization, excluding the sender. Apply the same effective-role,
  exchange-privilege and message-security-clearance checks as ordinary recipients.
  This means all eligible accounts, not a separate HR employee register.
- Freeze the concrete audience at send time. Deliver once per person; To wins
  when an ordinary To selection overlaps Everyone in Cc. Only concrete To
  recipients have action responsibilities. Existing recipient limits apply.
- Offer Everyone directly beside each recipient field, with localized English
  and Arabic wording; do not create a role, enumerate units, or preload users.
- API selector: `selector_kind: "everyone"`, `target_id: null`, and
  `recipient_type: "to"` or `"cc"`. Reject mixed To-Everyone selections, multiple
  Everyone selectors, or Everyone-Cc combined with other Cc selectors. Apply
  these composition rules to draft writes, validation and send. Incomplete
  drafts may omit To; sending may not.
- Persist the synthetic selector with null user, role and organizational-unit
  references. Localize its display in mailboxes and capture PDFs.

This extension concerns human messages only; system-notification configuration
audiences retain their existing user/role/organizational-unit contract.

### MSG-006 — Fan-out

Sending one envelope to multiple addressees shall create exactly one recipient
copy for each distinct addressee. Every copy shall have a different globally
unique ID. All copies shall refer to the same envelope. Subject, priority,
rich-text body, action-required state, receipt request, sender snapshot, and
relationship references are stored once on that envelope and are not duplicated
into delivery rows. Address selectors and expanded addresses are also stored
once per envelope rather than copied into every delivery.

Each delivery row stores only the recipient-specific identity and state needed
for that user's inbox, including recipient user, `To`/`Cc` classification,
mailbox sequence, creation time, and read time. Reading a recipient copy joins
that delivery to its message envelope and address rows.

Read state is independent for each recipient. Reading one copy must not mark
any other recipient's copy as read.

The envelope and all recipient copies shall commit in one transaction. If any
part fails, none of them is committed. This is the send's atomicity guarantee.

### MSG-007 — Reply

A sender with `messaging.user_messages.exchange` may create a new message as a
reply to a recipient copy they are allowed to read. The new envelope shall
store relationship kind `reply` and that copy's globally unique ID in
`related_delivery_id`.

Opening Reply to a human-authored message automatically adds the original
sender as a user selector in the To field. An ordinary reply allows that
selection to be changed; a completion acknowledgment keeps the original
sender in To as required below. Reopening a saved reply preserves its saved
recipient choices.

A new reply prefills its editable Subject with `Re: [original subject]`, using
`Re: ` followed by the original subject exactly. `Re:` remains the conventional
reply prefix in every interface language. The user may edit the subject;
reopening a saved reply preserves the saved subject. The existing subject
length limit still applies. Reply priority starts at Normal. The initial
security level is the original message's level and cannot be lowered below
its required security floor under MSG-014.

The earlier body shall not be embedded automatically in the reply.
The earlier message remains a separate item and is loaded only when the user
opens the link to it. A recipient of the reply receives the same read-only
linked-message access defined for a forward; possession of the referenced UUID
without a delivery of the reply does not grant access.

A sender uses **Send follow-up**, rather than Reply, for a message in their
Outbox. The original sender may create a new message with relationship kind
`follow_up` and `related_envelope_id` pointing to an active Outbox envelope
they currently own and may read. The follow-up is a new immutable envelope with
a newly selected recipient list; recipients are not automatically inherited
from the earlier message. The earlier subject and body are linked, not embedded
or copied.

Receiving the follow-up grants the same read-only linked-message access defined
for a forward, subject to MSG-020 retention-group access, the recipient's current
clearance, and all resource-specific authorization checks. Individual expiry
of the earlier message does not break this authorized read-only link.
The UI shall call this operation **Send follow-up**, not Reply, so it does not
imply that the sender is replying to themselves.

### MSG-008 — Forward

A sender with `messaging.user_messages.exchange` may create a new message as a
forward of a recipient copy they are allowed to read. The new envelope shall
store relationship kind `forward` and that copy's globally unique ID in
`related_delivery_id`.

The original sender may also forward an active Outbox envelope they currently
own and may read. In that case, the new envelope stores relationship kind
`forward` and the earlier envelope's globally unique ID in
`related_envelope_id`. The sender chooses a new recipient list; the earlier
recipients are not automatically inherited.

The earlier subject or body shall not be embedded automatically in the forward.
A forward is a link to an earlier message, not a content copy. Receiving the
forward grants that recipient read-only access through the forward to the
complete earlier message, including its sender, subject, security level,
priority, action-required flag, body, resource links, and original `To` and `Cc`
selector headers.

MSG-020 keeps connected messages together and permits this read-only access to
an earlier expired message while its retention group exists. It does not make
that message eligible for new reply/forward operations or restore its mailbox
entry.

This grant does not expose another recipient's delivery row, read state, or the
sender's read-receipt status because those are recipient-specific operational
state rather than shared message content. Possession of a delivery UUID alone
never grants access; the server derives the grant from an authenticated user's
own delivery of the forwarding envelope.

One envelope may have at most one relationship kind and one valid source. A
reply uses a delivery source; a follow-up uses an Outbox-envelope source; and a
forward uses either a delivery source or an Outbox-envelope source, never both.

An envelope marked `is_test = true` or whose `message_kind` is
`action_amendment_notice` cannot be used as the source of a reply, forward, or
follow-up.

### MSG-009 — Read state

A recipient may mark only their own copy as read. The first successful
transition records `read_at`. Repeating the operation is idempotent and must not
change the original timestamp.

Displaying a toast or listing a message in the inbox does not mark it as read.
The UI marks it as read when the user opens the message.

### MSG-010 — Read receipts

The sender may request read receipts for an envelope. When requested, the
sender may see which recipient copies have been read and the first-read time of
each copy.

The receipt is derived from the durable recipient copy's `read_at` value. It
does not depend on the recipient remaining connected and does not require a
separate external delivery channel. Reading a copy before or after a network
interruption produces the same durable result once the read request succeeds.

If read receipts were not requested, recipient read state shall not be exposed
to the sender through the messaging interface.

### MSG-011 — Resource links

A body may contain structured links to Wathiq records and aggregations. These
links reference existing resources; they do not copy files into the message or
grant access to the resources. Digital components are not selectable message
resources. To refer to a file, the sender selects its containing record; the
recipient opens the record and accesses its components under the record's
ordinary authorization rules. Full-text matches within a digital component
therefore identify its containing record as the selectable result.

A linked resource's effective security-level number must be less than or equal
to the message's security-level number:

```text
linked_resource_security_level_number <= message_security_level_number
```

The sender must also be currently authorized to read the resource. A resource
that the sender cannot read, or whose level is higher than the message level,
cannot be added. Changing the compose form's message level shall immediately
revalidate every existing resource link. The server shall repeat resource
existence, sender authorization, and security-level validation in the final
send transaction; client validation is not sufficient.

Wathiq resource links shall be inserted through the structured resource-link
control and stored separately from ordinary external hyperlinks. A raw internal
URL must not bypass resource validation. The rich-text renderer associates each
stored link occurrence with its normalized resource-link row.

One message may contain at most 50 structured Wathiq resource links by default.
The limit is a validated positive environment configuration value, is returned
by the compose capabilities API, and is enforced again in the send transaction.
Ordinary external hyperlinks in rich text remain governed by body-size and
sanitization rules rather than this structured-link count.

A message link does not grant access to its target resource. Whenever the
server evaluates link status for an Inbox page, opens a message, or opens a
resource, it must check the target's current existence, lifecycle, security
level, authentication, and authorization requirements. The link is currently
unavailable to a recipient when, among other reasons:

- the recipient no longer has sufficient effective clearance or another
  required permission for the resource;
- the resource's current security level has risen above the message level;
- the resource is no longer readable in its current lifecycle state; or
- the resource has been deleted or no longer exists.

If the message itself remains readable, an unavailable resource link shall be
rendered as a non-clickable, non-disclosing placeholder with a localized reason
appropriate to what the user is permitted to know. The message remains readable
and its other valid links remain usable. The API must not return protected
target metadata merely to explain the failure.

Authorization revocation cannot retract information that a recipient already
read, copied, cached, printed, or captured before the change. These rules
prevent subsequent retrieval and make current unavailability visible; they do
not claim retroactive erasure.

### MSG-012 — Rich text safety

The body shall use Wathiq's approved rich-text format. The server shall validate
and sanitize it on write against an explicit allowlist. Executable script,
event-handler attributes, unsafe URLs, active embedded content, and other
unsupported markup shall be rejected or removed before storage.

The client shall render only the sanitized representation. Sanitization is a
security boundary and must not rely only on browser-side code.

### MSG-013 — Immutability

After send, the sender, address list, subject, priority, security level, body,
`action_required`, action due fields, receipt request, reply link, forward link,
follow-up link, and sent time shall not change while the send-level content is
retained. Final purge follows MSG-020: the complete retention group is deleted
together, without envelope, delivery, or action-amendment tombstones.

Recipient first-read timestamps follow MSG-009. Reply-based completion
acknowledgments follow MSG-015, and append-only action amendments follow MSG-023;
neither rewrites the original envelope. Mailbox-reference deletion,
restoration, retention expiry, and final content purge are governed by MSG-020.
Deleting one mailbox reference does not alter another user's reference or
authorize premature purge of shared content.

This specification does not permit editing, recalling, or archiving sent
messages.

### MSG-014 — Message security level

Every envelope shall have exactly one Wathiq security level. It must never be
null. The default is the active configured security level having the lowest
`level_number`, consistent with Wathiq's existing baseline-level rule.

The sender's effective clearance is the greatest `level_number` among the
sender's currently effective roles, using the existing Wathiq security model.
The user sender may select only a message security level whose `level_number`
is less than or equal to that effective clearance. If the sender makes no
explicit selection, the lowest configured level is used. A user sender with no
effective role cannot send a message because even the mandatory baseline level
cannot be authorized through an effective role.

A system-message producer has authority to use only the lowest configured
security level. It cannot request, retain, or derive authority to assign a
higher message level.

Every concrete recipient of a secured message must have current effective
clearance greater than or equal to the message's security-level number at send
time:

```text
recipient_effective_clearance_number >= message_security_level_number
```

For a direct-user selector, a user below the required clearance cannot be
selected. A role or organizational-unit selector expands only to users who
meet the message clearance. If it resolves to no eligible user at the selected
level, that selector cannot be added to `To` or `Cc`.

The server shall re-evaluate the sender, selected message level, selectors, and
every expanded recipient in the final send transaction. Client-side filtering
or an earlier recipient preview is not sufficient authorization.

A secured reply, forward, or follow-up must have a security level at least as
restrictive as every referenced earlier message. The sender must be cleared for
that level, and every new recipient must satisfy it. A link must not be used to
disclose a more highly secured earlier message through an unsecured or
lower-level reply, forward, or follow-up.

When a secured message or linked earlier message is opened, the server shall
re-evaluate the authenticated user's current effective clearance. A user whose
clearance has since fallen below the message level retains the delivery row but
cannot retrieve protected subject, body, headers, or resource-link details
unless sufficient clearance is restored.

### MSG-015 — Action due date, acknowledgment, and lateness

When `action_required = true`, the sender may supply an `action_due_date` as an
informational target date. The date does not define what the action is and does
not create assignment, progress, escalation, approval, or workflow behavior.
When `action_required = false`, `action_due_date` and its timing fields must be
null.

The sender enters the due date as a local date in their effective Wathiq
working timezone. The server stores:

- the entered `action_due_date`;
- the sender's IANA `action_due_timezone` snapshot; and
- `action_due_at`, the instant at the start of the following local date in that
  timezone.

The recipient has the whole selected local date in which to act. The stored
boundary gives every viewer the same instant for evaluating lateness. At send
time, the due date must be today or later in the sender's working timezone.

Action requirements apply only to concrete To recipients. Cc means an
informational copy: its owner has no action to complete, no Outstanding or
Late status, and no completion control. If the same person is expanded through
both To and Cc selectors, the existing To precedence makes them a To recipient.

Action completion is tracked independently for each To delivery. When a
To recipient replies to an action-required message and their delivery is not yet
completed, the compose UI shall prompt **Is the action done?** The default is
unchecked. If checked, sending the reply atomically records one immutable
completion acknowledgment for that recipient's original delivery and links it
to the reply envelope.

The completion acknowledgment is permitted only when:

- the authenticated user owns the original recipient delivery and it is To;
- the reply's `relationship_kind` is `reply` and its `related_delivery_id` is
  that delivery ID;
- the original user sender is a `To` recipient of the reply and cannot be
  removed while **Is the action done?** is checked;
- the original envelope has `action_required = true`; and
- no completion has already been recorded for that delivery.

The completion control's guidance shall say: **Check “Is the action done?” to
tell the sender you have completed the requested action. Your reply will be
sent to them.** This explains the existing completion acknowledgment rule;
it does not create an additional notification or a separate send operation.

The reply containing the completion acknowledgment informs the original sender
through the ordinary durable reply delivery and its near-real-time notification.
The reply shall visibly state **Action completed**. The original sender's
per-recipient action status shall update accordingly. This creates no separate
email, escalation, or workflow task.

For each delivery, the current action status is derived as follows:

| Condition | Status |
| --- | --- |
| The delivery is Cc, or the original envelope has `action_required = false` | Not applicable (API `action_status = null`) |
| Completion exists and the latest fair effective due boundary is null or was not passed | Completed |
| Completion exists and `completed_at` passed the latest fair effective due boundary | Completed late |
| No completion exists and the effective action has been withdrawn | Withdrawn |
| No completion exists and the effective due boundary is null or has not passed | Outstanding |
| No completion exists and the effective due boundary has passed | Late |

The effective action and due boundary are derived from the immutable original
fields followed by the amendments in sequence under MSG-023. A later fair
extension or removal may correct Completed late to Completed, but an amendment
must never turn Completed into Completed late. `Late` is never stored as an
independent boolean. Both the original sender and the applicable original
recipient shall see the same derived late indicator. With multiple recipients,
one recipient's completion does not complete or change another recipient's
status.

Crossing the due boundary does not create a new message, toast, escalation, or
background workflow. The indicator is derived whenever the authorized inbox,
message, or sent-status view is read or refreshed.

An ordinary reply with **Is the action done?** unchecked leaves the action
outstanding. A completion acknowledgment is not a read receipt and does not
imply that Wathiq verified the action's substance or quality. This revision does
not define reversal or withdrawal of a completion acknowledgment. A completion
reply must reference the original delivery, never an amendment-notice delivery.

### MSG-016 — Outbox and drafts

Every authenticated human user with `messaging.user_messages.exchange` shall
have an Outbox containing their previously sent user messages. **Outbox** here
means the user's sent-message collection, not a queue waiting for delivery.
System-produced messages do not appear in a human user's Outbox.

An Outbox item is the original message envelope, not another recipient delivery
or a duplicate of its content. The sender may view its immutable content,
original selectors, expanded concrete recipients, read-receipt information
when requested, and per-recipient action status, subject to the sender's current
message clearance. Outbox listing and filtering shall use server-side
pagination.

A human user with `messaging.user_messages.exchange` may save an unsent private
draft. A draft may contain the same compose fields, recipient selectors, and
structured resource links as a message, but it has no sent time, delivery
copies, read state, receipts, mailbox sequence, toast, or action completion.
Only the owning user with current exchange privilege may list, read, edit,
send, or discard it.

A draft remains active for 180 days after its last update. The UI warns the
owner when 30 days remain. An expired or explicitly discarded draft moves to a
private **Recently deleted drafts** view for 30 additional days, during which
the owner may restore it. Restoration reopens the same draft but does not
restore stale recipient eligibility, clearance, or resource authorization.
After the deleted draft's restoration period, the subsystem permanently deletes
the draft and its draft-only selector and resource-link rows. Draft lifecycle
processing creates no message, delivery, toast, or record. The 180-day active
period, 30-day warning, and 30-day deleted-draft restoration period are
validated deployment settings, with these values as the defaults.

Saving a draft does not reserve recipient membership, authorization, resource
access, or security clearance. The UI may report its current validation state,
but sending must re-evaluate every rule from current authoritative data. A
successful send converts the draft to one immutable envelope atomically and
removes it from the Drafts page. A retry with the same idempotency key must not
send it twice.

### MSG-017 — Save a message as a Wathiq record

The sender or a recipient may save an ordinary human-authored message they are
currently authorized to read as a new record in an aggregation they choose.
This operation uses the existing record-draft and record-commit workflow rather
than bypassing record creation controls.

Only `message_kind = user_message` is eligible for message-to-record capture.
A `system_notification`—whether production or test—and an
`action_amendment_notice` cannot be selected or included as a linked message in
a capture. If an otherwise eligible user message has a relationship chain that
contains an ineligible kind, capture is blocked with a clear explanation rather
than silently omitting part of the chain. A feature whose business event must
itself create a record shall do so through that feature's approved backend
record-creation process, not by asking a recipient to preserve its notification.

The user must have:

- current authorization and clearance to read the selected message and every
  linked reply, forward, or follow-up message included in the capture;
- the existing `record.create` global privilege;
- `aggregation.add_record` permission on the chosen destination; and
- sufficient clearance and all ordinary destination, closure, ownership,
  numbering, and record-creation requirements.

No new messaging privilege substitutes for these existing record controls.

#### Initialize the record draft

The record draft is initialized as follows:

- record `title` defaults to the selected message subject and remains editable
  under the ordinary record-draft rules;
- record `date_originated` defaults to the selected message's `sent_at`;
- record `security_level_id` is fixed initially to the selected message level
  and cannot be lowered below the highest level among included messages;
- the user chooses the destination aggregation and supplies or confirms every
  other required record field, including the record number;
- the generated message PDFs are the authoritative message content preserved
  in the record; and
- separate capture-provenance metadata records the source message-envelope ID,
  the user who performed the capture, the capture time, and the resulting
  record ID. The same provenance is rendered into a human-readable PDF and
  saved as the record's final digital component. Later expiry or purging of the
  source messaging data does not alter or invalidate the captured record.

#### Message PDFs and provenance

The selected message is rendered as a human-readable PDF and staged as digital
component 1. The PDF preserves the message's immutable sender, sent time,
original `To`/`Cc` selector headers, subject, priority, security level,
original action-required and due-date fields, the chronological
action-amendment history and effective state at capture time, sanitized body,
and human-readable structured resource links. Recipient-specific read receipts
and other users' delivery state are not included.

If the selected message is a reply, forward, or follow-up, every earlier
message reachable through its relationship references shall also be captured
once, provided the capturing user is currently authorized to read it. Those
linked messages are rendered as separate PDFs and staged as subsequent digital
components ordered by `sent_at` ascending with message ID as the deterministic
tie-breaker. The selected message remains component 1 as required;
chronological ordering applies to components 2 onward. A reference cycle or
duplicate reference is rejected as integrity corruption rather than producing
repeated components.

After all message PDFs, Wathiq shall generate a **Message capture provenance**
PDF as the final digital component. It contains the capture ID, resulting record
ID and number, selected source envelope ID, capture date and time with timezone,
capturing user's immutable name and identifier snapshots, and an ordered list
of every included message component showing its component order, role
(`selected message` or `linked earlier message`), envelope ID, sent time, and
generated filename. This PDF contains provenance only; it does not repeat the
message bodies, recipient delivery state, or resource contents.

The provenance PDF is part of the authoritative captured record, while the
structured capture tables remain the queryable audit and referential layer.
Both representations are created from the same transaction data and must
agree. A mismatch or inability to render the provenance PDF fails the capture
without committing a partial record.

#### Limits, validation, and commit

One capture may include at most 100 linked earlier messages in addition to the
selected message and final provenance PDF, and all generated PDFs combined may
not exceed 50 MiB. Both limits are checked before record commit. Exceeding
either limit blocks capture without creating a partial record and tells the
user which limit was exceeded. The limits are validated deployment settings
with these values as defaults; raising them requires PDF-renderer, storage,
request-duration, and record-view performance testing.

If any required linked message becomes inaccessible, the message body or
stored resource-link metadata cannot be rendered faithfully, or any
authorization check fails before commit, capture fails without creating a
partial record. Loss of access to the resource itself does not prevent capture:
the PDF preserves the safe stored link description and indicates that current
access is unavailable. Ordinary message resource links remain references in
the PDF; saving a message as a record does not extract, duplicate, or grant
access to the linked resources.

PDF generation and component staging shall be deterministic and bounded. The
record and all generated components become authoritative together only when the
existing record draft commits successfully. The resulting record and component
history shall identify that they were created by the message-capture workflow.
Saving the same message more than once is permitted when the user deliberately
creates distinct records; each capture is independently authorized and audited.

#### PDF format and filenames

Every generated component shall conform to both PDF/A-2u and PDF/UA-1. Failure
to produce or validate either required conformance blocks record commit. The
PDF shall be tagged with logical reading order, Unicode text
mapping, document title and language metadata, embedded fonts, descriptive link
text, heading and list structure, and correct LTR or RTL direction. Information
must not be conveyed by color alone. Sanitized rich text that cannot be
represented safely in this archival profile is rendered as safe text rather
than active content.

Component filenames use only stable non-sensitive values:
`message-<UTC-sent-timestamp>-<envelope-uuid>.pdf`, where the timestamp is
formatted `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`. The subject and sender name are not placed in the
filename. Filename collisions are impossible within a capture because envelope
IDs are globally unique. The final provenance component uses
`message-capture-provenance-<capture-uuid>.pdf`.

### MSG-018 — Production of system notifications

A system message may be created only by registered backend notification
producer logic. There is no public or frontend API that accepts
`sender_kind = system`, a system-producer identity, or arbitrary system-message
content. Ordinary NiceGUI, Flutter, and other client operations cannot send as
`system` or provide per-event system-message recipients, subject, body,
priority, resource links, receipt setting, or action fields. Privileged
administrative configuration is limited to MSG-019 and never directly sends an
ordinary production event. Its explicitly marked test-send operation is the
only exception and cannot create a production notification.

A client action may nevertheless cause a system notification indirectly. The
client invokes an ordinary authorized business operation, such as an approved
domain command. After independently authenticating, authorizing, and validating
that operation, backend business logic decides whether a defined notification
event has occurred. The notification is a consequence of the committed
business operation, not a client-authored messaging request. A rejected or
no-op business request must not create its success notification.

Every producer shall be registered under a stable `producer_code`. Its approved
contract defines:

- the domain event or backend condition it may report;
- the allowed static and/or named backend recipient-resolution modes;
- the allowlisted subject/body placeholder schema and renderer;
- allowed priority and resource-link behavior;
- the stable domain-event identifier used for idempotency; and
- whether durable notification creation is required for the associated business
  transaction to commit.

The feature-owned flag `required_for_business_commit` controls whether the
business change may commit without its notification:

- **Required producer (`true`):** administrators cannot disable it. The
  registered event, envelope, and all deliveries must commit together. A
  notification failure rolls back the business change.
- **Optional producer (`false`), disabled:** the business operation may commit
  without creating a notification.
- **Optional producer (`false`), enabled:** the business change and attempted
  notification still commit together. A notification failure rolls back the
  transaction.

`required_for_business_commit` does not set message priority, request a read
receipt or action, require the recipient to read the message, or require a toast
or live event to reach a connected client before commit. The required outcome
is durable database creation, not user attention or real-time presentation.

The initial producer registry may be empty. Each feature that later introduces
a system notification must define and test its producer contract in its
approved specification and backend code before enabling the producer. The
messaging subsystem does not require a list of all future producers in advance.
The registry is an application allowlist: administrators configure registered
entries through MSG-019 but cannot create a producer, event trigger, resolver,
placeholder, or executable behavior.

#### Concrete backend integration

Backend Python code registers producers and calls the notification service
explicitly. Registration is not a REST operation, and the service does not
automatically subscribe to business events.

Each feature that introduces notifications provides a declarative Python
`SystemNotificationDefinition`. At minimum it contains the producer code, event
type, typed placeholder schema, allowed audience resolver names, allowed
resource-link kinds, `required_for_business_commit` policy, and contract
version. The API application assembles these definitions into one registry
explicitly during startup; registration must not depend on an incidental module
import or a client request.

The feature's canonical catalogue seed creates its producer row for a new
deployment, while an upgrade migration advances the row for an existing
deployment when the contract changes. Seeds remain separate from schema
creation. On startup, every API instance read-only compares the database
producer row and contract version with the Python registry. A missing, unknown,
duplicate, or incompatible definition whose
`required_for_business_commit = true` fails readiness with a clear configuration
error instead of silently dropping required notifications.

Feature backend code calls one internal Python application-service operation at
the exact point where the approved business outcome is written. The conceptual
interface is:

```python
notification_service.emit_system_notification(
    transaction=db_transaction,
    producer_code="feature.approved_event",
    source_event_id=str(domain_event_id),
    context={
        "declared_text_value": bounded_text,
        "declared_date_value": domain_date,
    },
    triggered_by_user_id=current_user_id,
)
```

The actual Python module and type names may follow repository conventions, but
the operation has these mandatory semantics:

- it accepts the caller's already-open PostgreSQL transaction and never commits
  it independently;
- it accepts only producer code, stable source-event ID, schema-validated
  context values, and optional triggering-user provenance;
- it does not accept subject, body, priority, security level, arbitrary
  recipients, arbitrary resource links, or a sender identity from the caller;
- it loads and locks the producer's active administration configuration;
- it validates the context against the registered typed placeholder schema;
- it invokes only the registered static/dynamic audience resolver and permitted
  resource-link builder;
- it verifies published template coverage, renders and sanitizes every enabled-
  language variant, forces the baseline security level and prohibited
  receipt/action fields, and calls the canonical envelope/fan-out writer; and
- it returns a typed result containing the created envelope and delivery IDs,
  the existing result for an identical retry, or `message_result_purged` when
  that successful result was already purged under section 8; a new event may
  instead return a defined `disabled` result for a producer whose
  `required_for_business_commit = false` and active configuration is disabled.
  Validation or required-configuration failure raises a domain error and rolls
  back the caller's transaction.

The business feature must not insert messaging tables directly. A scheduled
backend job may call the same operation while updating its governed domain state
in the same transaction. A separately deployed service that cannot participate
in that PostgreSQL transaction cannot produce a system notification in this
revision; that topology would require the later transactional-intent extension.

The privileged REST operation used by **Send test** is deliberately separate.
It calls an internal `emit_system_notification_test` operation that enforces
MSG-019 and always sets immutable test provenance. It cannot invoke the
production operation with a fabricated domain event.

A producer has no general messaging authority beyond that contract. It cannot
accept a client-supplied producer code or use a recipient rule or template
capability outside the active validated administration configuration and
feature contract. User-entered template values remain untrusted data. They must
be bounded, escaped or sanitized, and stored as part of the resulting message.
They must not be interpreted as executable markup or template instructions.

System messages always use the lowest active configured security level as
required by MSG-014. A producer may include only resource-link kinds explicitly
allowed by its registered contract, and only when backend authorization policy
permits that exact link at the baseline level. Producer status is not a general
bypass of resource authorization. A system message shall always have
`read_receipt_requested = false` and `action_required = false`; system producers
cannot request receipts, set an action due date, or receive action-completion
acknowledgments.

Whenever a production system notification is created, it commits in the same
PostgreSQL transaction as the business change that caused it. That transaction
includes the envelope, recipient snapshots, deliveries, mailbox sequences, and
`NOTIFY` calls. If notification validation or creation fails, the complete
transaction rolls back. The caller may retry the ordinary business operation
using its stable idempotency key; retrying must not create a duplicate domain
change or notification.

The explicitly marked administration test in MSG-019 has no domain change. Its
test envelope, recipients, mailbox sequences, and notifications commit in one
standalone transaction or not at all.

There is no asynchronous system-notification intent queue, retry worker, or
manual notification replay operation in this revision. Adding one later would
be a separately approved extension. Backend work that cannot share the domain
transaction must not claim to have produced a system notification under this
contract.

### MSG-019 — System notification administration

System-notification configuration shall be administered from a **Notification
Administration** page under the Messages navigation category. Access requires
the new `messaging.notifications.administer` global privilege, granted by
default only to `SYS_ADMIN` and `ALL_PRIVS`. The privilege is independent of
`messaging.monitor` and `audit.view`.

The administration page operates on producer definitions registered by
application features. Feature code supplies the immutable `producer_code`,
event type, allowed template placeholders and their data types, permitted
audience modes, permitted resource-link kinds, and whether notification is
`required_for_business_commit`. Administrators cannot create a new executable
event, change its trigger, submit arbitrary production event data, or directly
send a production system message from this page.

#### Permitted configuration

For each registered producer, an administrator may:

- enable or disable it only when `required_for_business_commit = false`;
- author, review, and publish the bounded subject and sanitized rich-text body
  template for every enabled language using only the producer's allowlisted
  placeholders;
- select `normal`, `high`, or `very_high` priority;
- configure a static audience of eligible users, roles, and organizational
  units, or select one of the feature's declared dynamic audience resolvers;
- configure allowed baseline-level resource-link presentation when the feature
  contract permits resource links; and
- record a non-blank operational owner name or team label.

The page cannot change the mandatory lowest security level or enable read
receipts, action-required state, due dates, executable template logic, arbitrary
queries, or resource types outside the feature contract. Static audience
selectors use the same active-user, deduplication, self-exclusion where
applicable, and recipient-limit rules as ordinary sending, but do not require
`messaging.user_messages.exchange`. Dynamic resolvers are named backend
implementations, not administrator-authored expressions.

Saving configuration validates placeholder parity and previews every enabled
language in its configured direction without sending. Each successful change
creates an immutable configuration version and
an event-history entry containing the actor, producer, changed safe fields,
reason, and timestamp. Enablement, audience, template, priority, and
resource-presentation changes are also flagged as Security Operations because
they can change who receives system-authored information. Secrets and example
protected event data are not stored in configuration history.

#### Controlled test sends

An administrator may test the active or pending valid configuration through a
dedicated **Send test** action. A test send:

- uses the real canonical envelope, delivery, mailbox-sequence, PostgreSQL
  `NOTIFY`, real-time gateway, Inbox, unread, and toast path;
- uses the selected immutable configuration version and either feature-provided
  safe sample values or administrator-entered values limited to the declared,
  typed, bounded, escaped placeholders;
- permits only explicitly selected active individual users as test recipients,
  never a role, organizational unit, configured static audience, or dynamic
  audience resolver;
- is limited by the configured test-recipient count and per-administrator rate
  limit;
- repeats every ordinary baseline security, recipient, resource-link, rich-
  text, size, and authorization check;
- stores `is_test = true`, the initiating administrator, and a unique test-run
  ID immutably on the envelope, using `test` as the source event type and the
  test-run ID as its idempotent source-event identity; and
- creates event-history and Security Operations entries identifying the
  producer, configuration version, initiator, recipient count, result, and
  correlation ID without storing protected content in the event.

Every presentation of a test message—including toast, Inbox row, message view,
and Notification Administration test history—shall show a prominent localized
**TEST — not a production notification** label. The indicator is derived from
the immutable server field, not from editable subject text, and is not conveyed
by color alone. The rendered subject is also prefixed for clarity, but the
prefix is not the security control.

A test message cannot request receipts or action, cannot be replied to,
forwarded, or followed up, and cannot be saved as a Wathiq record. It is
excluded from production notification success/failure rates and business
workflow counts but included in separate test-send operational metrics. It
expires after 30 days, may be deleted early from a test recipient's own Inbox
without record capture, and is purged through the ordinary deleted-message
restoration and retention-group cleanup mechanism.

#### Use of a configuration in production

When the feature event occurs, the business transaction locks and uses one
active configuration version, resolves and snapshots the concrete audience,
renders and sanitizes the allowlisted template, writes the resulting envelope
with its configuration-version ID, and commits atomically as required by
MSG-018. Later administration changes never rewrite an already-sent message.
An invalid configuration for an enabled producer causes the business
transaction to fail closed with an operational error. A producer whose
`required_for_business_commit = false` and active configuration is disabled
creates no message and does not prevent the business transaction from
committing.

### MSG-020 — Sent-message retention and deletion

#### Message expiry and mailbox restoration

Each sent message has its own expiry date, normally three years after
`sent_at`. Ninety days before that date, Inbox and Outbox show an expiry
indicator. Eligible human-authored messages also offer **Save as record**;
system notifications and amendment notices do not. Reconnection must not
produce one warning toast per expiring message.

Expiry removes a message from ordinary Inbox and Outbox views; it does not
necessarily mean its stored content is ready for permanent deletion. Connected
messages are kept together under the retention-group rule below.

Manual mailbox deletion and automatic expiry move the affected user's Inbox
or Outbox entry to **Recently deleted messages**. That entry has a 30-day
**restoration period**, during which its owner may restore it, subject to
current authorization. This is the restoration period for a deleted message
entry, not for a deleted user account. When it ends, that entry is no longer
available in Recently deleted and cannot be restored, even if its underlying
message remains stored for the rest of the conversation.

Restoring an entry does not change the message's original expiry date or give
it another three years. An entry restored before expiry returns to its ordinary
mailbox view until expiry. Restoring an already expired entry makes it available
only until its existing restoration deadline; at that deadline it leaves both
ordinary and Recently deleted views. Restoration must not restart the clock.
The entry's original expiry and restoration deadline must remain available to
enforce this rule, even when the UI shows it as restored. Repeated deletion and
restoration after expiry must not extend that deadline. Automatic expiry of an
entry already deleted early must not reopen or extend its restoration period.

Before expiry, a user may delete their own entry for an eligible human-authored
message only after saving that message as a record. The server must verify a
committed capture for that user and envelope and confirm that the record still
exists. A staged draft, another user's capture, or a record already disposed of
is insufficient. System notifications, including tests, and amendment notices
are capture-free deletion exceptions. Deleting one person's entry never
deletes another person's entry or the shared message content.

Automatic expiry applies whether or not the message has been captured as a
record. Captured records follow their own records-management rules: message
purge never deletes them, and record disposition never deletes a retained
message.

#### Keep the complete conversation until all its messages have expired

A **retention group** is the complete set of sent message envelopes connected
by replies, forwards, follow-ups, and action-amendment notices. A delivery-based
relationship connects the new envelope to the envelope owning the referenced
delivery. An amendment notice connects to the original envelope through its
action amendment. A message with no such connections is a one-message group.

Group membership includes every branch, not just the earlier messages visible
from one reply. If two replies or forwards share an earlier message, they
belong to the same group. Sending another linked message extends that group.
An unsent draft, an ordinary resource link, or a captured record is not a member
and does not extend the group's lifetime. Group membership is a retention rule,
not a group conversation, participant list, or access grant.

The complete group becomes eligible for permanent purge only when:

1. every message in the group has reached its own `expires_at`; and
2. every Inbox and Outbox entry in the group has ended its applicable deleted-
   message restoration period, with no active or restorable entry remaining.

Early mailbox deletion does not shorten this rule: even if everyone deletes
their entries early, all messages in the group must still reach their expiry
dates. Adding a later reply, forward, follow-up, or amendment notice can delay
purge for the entire group, including other branches. A conversation that keeps
growing can therefore retain older messages for longer than three years. This
is intentional; individual expiry dates do not promise a maximum physical
storage lifetime.

For example, a message sent in January and a reply sent in February remain
stored together until both have expired and all their deleted-message
restoration periods have ended. Cleanup then deletes both together. It must
not purge January's content while keeping February's reply with a missing
original.

#### Read earlier messages without restoring their mailbox entries

While a group remains stored, an authorized reader of a reply, forward, or
follow-up may open the earlier linked messages under MSG-007 and MSG-008, even
if those earlier messages have expired or their original mailbox entries are
no longer restorable. An authorized reader of an amendment notice may similarly
open its original message. The starting message must be accessible through the
reader's own active or restorable Inbox or Outbox entry.

Each step still requires current exchange privilege where applicable, message
clearance, and resource authorization. It reveals only the shared message
content allowed by the relationship grant, not another person's delivery,
receipt state, or other conversation branches. Knowing a UUID or belonging to
the same retention group grants no access. Expiry or deletion of an earlier
mailbox entry alone shall not break an otherwise-authorized link.

This access is read-only. It does not restore an old Inbox or Outbox entry or
make an expired/deleted source eligible for a new reply, forward, follow-up,
action completion, or amendment. Existing source-operation rules still apply.
Save as record remains subject to MSG-017 and its human-message-only rules.

#### Delete the group together

At final purge, delete all envelopes and their localizations, selectors,
addressees, deliveries, resource links, action completions, and action
amendments in the group. Remove their relationships in the same transaction. Do
not leave envelope, delivery, or action-amendment tombstone rows. Until that
transaction commits, the group's stored content and relationships remain
intact; after it commits, none of those message rows remains.

Independent records, capture provenance, required event history, and the
minimal request-deduplication receipts defined in section 8 survive under their
own rules. They must not keep the message rows alive. Their preserved
identifiers are historical references, not permission to retrieve deleted
messages. An old bookmark or client request for a purged message receives the
ordinary non-disclosing unavailable-message response. Independently retained
audit entries must identify deleted messages by historical UUID values, not
foreign keys that prevent their deletion.

Cleanup must recheck the complete group's membership and purge eligibility
under locks that also coordinate with message sends, amendments, and mailbox
restoration. Capture commits and draft sends must coordinate with those same
locks and revalidate their sources. A concurrent operation either commits first
and is included in the eligibility decision, or observes the completed purge
and fails without creating a dangling relationship. Multiple workers must not
purge the same group concurrently.

Discover candidates in bounded pages and process groups separately. A group
must never be split merely to meet a cleanup batch target. Large groups require
bounded discovery memory and an atomic database deletion; they must not be
loaded as complete message bodies into a worker. A failed or timed-out purge
rolls back the whole group and leaves it for retry. Operations monitoring must
report groups whose size or repeated failures delay cleanup.

### MSG-021 — Localization of system-generated messages

Human-authored message subjects and bodies are displayed exactly as authored;
Wathiq does not automatically translate them. Application UI around the
message—labels, priority names, dates, buttons, status, validation, and
placeholders—uses the ordinary UI catalogue and the viewer's effective language.

Each system-notification configuration version contains a subject and body
template for every enabled Wathiq language. English is the canonical/default
template and fallback. All language templates use the same declared named
placeholders with identical types and cardinality. A configuration version
cannot be activated while any enabled language is missing, blank, unreviewed,
or placeholder-incompatible. Enabling a new Wathiq language is blocked by the
existing language release-readiness process until every active system producer
has a valid template for it.

When a system event is emitted, the internal service renders and sanitizes an
immutable subject/body variant for every currently enabled language using the
same configuration version and typed event context. Locale-sensitive values
and translated controlled/entity display values are resolved under that
language at send time and snapshotted in the rendered variant. The envelope's
ordinary `subject` and `body_rich_text` columns contain the rendered system-
default-language variant for deterministic fallback; the language-variant rows
contain every rendered version, including the default.

Each delivery snapshots the recipient's effective language at send time. Its
live toast uses that language variant. Inbox and message retrieval use the
viewer's current effective language when that immutable variant exists, then
fall back deterministically to the envelope's system-default variant and
finally English. Changing a user preference changes which already-stored
variant is presented; it never translates at read time or modifies the
envelope. A language enabled after the send may fall back because that historic
envelope could not contain a then-unknown variant.

Recipient copies still reference one envelope. Localization creates one
subject/body row per language, not one copy of the complete message per
recipient. Read state, deletion state, receipts, and mailbox sequence remain
recipient-specific and language-independent.

Notification Administration edits templates per language, validates exact
placeholder parity, previews every enabled language and direction, and follows
the governed review and fallback principles of the approved Internationalization
and User Preferences specification. These administrator-authored notification
templates are versioned message configuration data, not UI catalogue strings;
the administration screen's own labels and errors remain ordinary catalogue
keys. Test sends render all language variants and each test recipient sees the
variant selected by their effective language.

Action-amendment notices use server-owned application templates maintained as
ordinary governed UI catalogue keys rather than administrator-editable producer
templates. At amendment commit, the server renders and stores one immutable
notice variant for every enabled language. Fixed wording, controlled action
states, and date presentation are localized; the sender-authored reason is
embedded verbatim and is never machine-translated. Toast and later-read variant
selection and fallback follow the same rules as a system notification.

System notifications are never eligible for message-to-record capture. Their
localized variants remain messaging content until their retention group is
purged under MSG-020. The underlying business object, event history, audit entry,
or feature-created record—not the notification—is the authoritative evidence of
the event being reported.

### MSG-022 — Person-to-person messaging privilege

The global privilege `messaging.user_messages.exchange` controls both sending
and receiving human-authored messages. It is a seeded immutable privilege and
is included automatically in `ALL_PRIVS`; other profiles receive it only by
explicit profile administration. System producers and system-message receipt
do not require or inherit this privilege.

A person with the privilege may use Compose, Drafts, and Outbox; send, reply,
forward, and follow up human-authored messages; be selected directly; and be
included by human-message role or organizational-unit expansion, subject to
every other clearance, lifecycle, visibility, and messaging rule.

A person without the privilege:

- retains the Messages category and Inbox, but Inbox lists and counts only
  system-generated messages, including unmistakably marked system tests;
- has no Compose action and no Outbox or Drafts navigation or API access;
- cannot send, reply to, forward, or follow up a human-authored message;
- cannot be selected directly or included by a role or organizational-unit
  expansion for a human-authored message; and
- remains eligible for system notifications independently of this privilege.

Losing the privilege does not delete envelopes, deliveries, drafts, record
captures, or history. Existing human-authored Inbox deliveries become hidden
from listing, unread counts, catch-up, and content retrieval; Outbox and Drafts
become inaccessible. Restoring the privilege restores access subject to current
security clearance, retention, deletion, and resource authorization. Draft
expiry continues while hidden.

`messaging.monitor`, `messaging.notifications.administer`, and `audit.view`
remain independent. A user lacking exchange privilege sees their privilege-
gated Monitor or Notification Administration link only if they separately hold
the applicable privilege; those administrative capabilities do not grant
person-to-person mailbox access.

### MSG-023 — Immutable action amendments

Sending never edits an existing message envelope. When the action-required
setting or due date needs correction, the original human sender may append an
immutable structured action amendment to the original envelope. The original
`action_required`, due-date fields, subject, body, sender, recipients,
priority, security level, resource links, receipt setting, and relationship
references remain unchanged.

#### Permitted amendments

Only these amendments are permitted for an envelope originally sent with
`action_required = true`:

- add a due date when the original/effective action has none;
- change the effective due date;
- remove the effective due date while leaving the action outstanding; or
- withdraw the action requirement for every incomplete recipient.

An informational message cannot be amended into an action request. An action
withdrawal cannot be reversed or reactivated; a new action requires a new
message. No amendment may change message content, priority, security, address
list, resource links, read-receipt behavior, or any recipient's completion
acknowledgment. Amendments apply to the complete original concrete audience and
cannot target selected recipients.

The amendment stores its own globally unique ID, monotonically increasing
sequence within the original envelope, kind, previous effective action state
and due fields, new effective state and due fields, original sender as actor,
server-assigned time, and a mandatory non-blank reason. It is append-only and
cannot be edited, replaced, reordered, or deleted through messaging operations.
The effective action state is derived from the original envelope followed by
its amendments in sequence; no mutable effective-state column is authoritative.

#### Fairness rules

The following fairness rules are mandatory:

- a newly added or changed due boundary must be in the future when the
  amendment commits, using the sender's validated working-timezone snapshot;
- an amendment must not make an incomplete recipient immediately or
  retroactively Late;
- it must not change a recipient from Completed to Completed late;
- extending or removing a superseded deadline immediately removes a current
  Late indicator caused by that deadline;
- the original and superseded dates remain visible in amendment history, but
  the ordinary current status must not continue to characterize a recipient as
  late against a deadline the sender corrected; and
- withdrawal changes every incomplete recipient to Withdrawn, while recipients
  already completed remain Completed or Completed late under the latest fair
  effective due date preceding withdrawal.

#### Authorization and the amendment notice

The sender must currently own the original envelope, retain access to its
active Outbox reference, have `messaging.user_messages.exchange`, and satisfy
the original message's current clearance. The amendment and its recipient
notices are created atomically using the original concrete recipient set. A
recipient who has since lost exchange privilege retains the delivery rows but
does not see human-authored message or amendment-notice content until the
privilege is restored; current clearance checks also continue to apply.

The authoritative amendment is a row in `message_action_amendments`. The same
transaction creates one specialized immutable notification envelope with
`message_kind = action_amendment_notice`, the original sender identity and
security level, priority, expiry, and one recipient copy for every original
recipient. It contains no resource links. The notice
uses server-owned localized templates and the ordinary durable mailbox,
PostgreSQL `NOTIFY`, real-time event, Inbox, unread, and toast path. Its `To`/`Cc`
classification follows each recipient's original classification and cannot be
edited by the sender.

An amendment notice is a delivery mechanism, not the authoritative correction.
It cannot be replied to, forwarded, followed up, used for action completion, or
independently saved as a record. Opening it marks only that notice delivery as
read and provides **Open amended message**, which opens the original message
with its complete action-amendment timeline. Replies and completion
acknowledgments continue to reference the original recipient delivery.
Forwarding the original message exposes its current effective action state and
amendment history under the ordinary linked-message authorization rules.

#### Presentation, retention, and capture

For the sender, an amendment notice does not appear as an unrelated Outbox
item. The original Outbox detail displays it in the action-amendment timeline.
For recipients, the notice appears in Inbox with an unmistakable localized
**Action amended** indication, the old and new effective state/date, amendment
time, sender, and reason, subject to current authorization. Notice read state
means only that the correction notice was opened; it is not acceptance.

The amendment notice uses the original envelope's retention expiry and may be
deleted early by its recipient without record capture because it cannot itself
become a record. The authoritative amendment, notice, and original envelope
belong to the same retention group and are purged together under MSG-020.
Deleting a notice from one Inbox never removes the amendment timeline from the
retained original. There is no separate permanent purge of a notice while its
group remains.

Capturing the original message as a record includes the immutable original
action fields and a clearly separated chronological **Action amendments**
section containing every amendment committed by capture time, plus the
effective action state and language at capture. The amendment notice is not a
separate captured component. A record captured before a later amendment is not
silently rewritten; a user may perform a new capture when the later history
must also become a record.

## 5. Priority and action-required meaning

Priority is a required controlled value. The initial values are:

| Stored value | Display meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `normal` | Ordinary priority |
| `high` | Important and visually emphasized |
| `very_high` | Highest priority and strongly emphasized |

Priority affects ordering and presentation only. It must not bypass
authorization, change delivery durability, or create an external alert.

`action_required = false` means the message is informational.
`action_required = true` tells the recipient that the message calls for an
action. The optional due date, reply-based completion acknowledgment, and
derived late indicator have only the narrow meanings in MSG-015. They do not
define the action itself, validate its completion, or create escalation or a
workflow.

## 6. User experience

### 6.1 Navigation

The navigation drawer shall contain a **Messages** category immediately below
**Records Management**. For an authenticated human user it contains, in order
when applicable:

1. **Inbox**;
2. **Outbox**, only with `messaging.user_messages.exchange`;
3. **Drafts**, only with `messaging.user_messages.exchange`;
4. **Monitor**, only when the user has the new `messaging.monitor` global
   privilege; and
5. **Notification Administration**, only when the user has
   `messaging.notifications.administer`.

`messaging.monitor` is a dedicated least-privilege capability. Reusing
`audit.view` would unnecessarily grant the complete system-wide audit surface,
while monitoring messaging does not require reading message content. The
initial privilege shall be granted by default to the built-in `SYS_ADMIN` and
deliberately comprehensive `ALL_PRIVS` profiles. Other profiles receive it only
through explicit administration.

The Monitor page exposes sanitized operational information such as send and
fan-out rates, failures, PostgreSQL listener health/reconnections, connected
real-time gateways, catch-up failures, restricted-message counts, PDF-capture
failures, and oldest unresolved operational error. It shall not expose message
subjects, bodies, selector names, recipient identities, resource metadata, or
permit message impersonation, mutation, or mailbox browsing.

A Monitor user who also has `audit.view` may follow an authorized link to
relevant event-history entries. `messaging.monitor` alone does not grant that
access, and `audit.view` alone does not make the Messages Monitor navigation
item visible.

Notification Administration is the configuration surface defined in MSG-019.
Its privilege does not grant mailbox browsing, message-content access,
operational Monitor access, or general event-history access.

### 6.2 Inbox

The inbox shall show only recipient copies belonging to the authenticated user.
It shall support server-side pagination and shall not download the user's whole
mailbox. Its default order is newest `sent_at` first, with recipient-copy ID as
a deterministic tie-breaker. Read state and priority may be exposed as filters
or deliberate alternate sort choices.

The inbox shall distinguish unread messages, `To` from `Cc`, priority, and
action-required messages. For a readable action-required delivery it shall also
show the due date when present and the recipient's current Outstanding, Late,
Completed, or Completed late indicator. It shall have deliberate loading,
empty, and error states and follow Wathiq's established table/list
presentation.

Without `messaging.user_messages.exchange`, the same Inbox page and pagination
contract return only envelopes with `sender_kind = system`. Human-authored
deliveries are not returned as rows or counted as unread while the privilege is
absent.

A delivery shall remain present when the recipient no longer has sufficient
current clearance to view the message. Instead of silently omitting it, the
inbox shall show a non-disclosing **Restricted message** placeholder. The
placeholder preserves mailbox ordering, unread accounting, and awareness that a
delivery exists, while revealing no sender, subject, priority, action-required
state, headers, body, or resource information. It shall explain that the user's
current authorization no longer permits access. If clearance is later restored,
the ordinary message row becomes visible again.

For a readable message containing structured Wathiq resource links, the inbox
shall show a generic indicator when one or more links are currently unavailable,
without naming or describing an inaccessible resource. Opening the message
shows the permitted per-link status described in MSG-011.

The inbox service shall determine message-clearance and linked-resource status
for the bounded current page using set-based or bounded-batch authorization
queries. It must not issue one API or database round trip per message or per
link, and it must not scan the user's complete mailbox.

Inbox exposes **Delete** only when the authenticated recipient has a currently
retained committed record capture satisfying MSG-020, or the envelope is a
system notification or action-amendment notice that is ineligible for capture.
Inbox exposes **Save as record** only for an eligible human-authored message.
It shows the configured expiry date and warning state. A **Recently deleted**
view within Inbox lists only that user's deleted Inbox entries still within
their restoration period and provides Restore; it is not a separate
navigation-drawer item.

### 6.3 Message view

Opening a message shall fetch the current user's copy by its globally unique ID,
re-check current message clearance, render the sanitized body, show its
immutable metadata, and mark the copy read. A delivery that the user can no
longer clear shall remain counted and identifiable only through a
non-disclosing restricted-message state; opening it must not reveal its subject,
body, headers, sender, or resource links and must not mark it read.

Reply and forward controls shall create a new compose operation with the
appropriate link. Reply prefills the editable subject as specified in MSG-007;
neither operation quotes or embeds the earlier body.

Replying to an incomplete action-required delivery shall show the explicit
unchecked **Is the action done?** prompt. After an acknowledgment is recorded,
later replies shall show the existing completion status and shall not offer a
second completion control.

### 6.4 Compose

The Compose route, action, and API require
`messaging.user_messages.exchange`. Hiding the UI is not authorization; the
server rejects send, reply, and forward requests without the privilege.

Recipient controls shall use the current frontend's existing shared user, role,
and organizational-unit selector components as required by MSG-005A. Those
components shall use bounded remote search and retain selected values. They
must not obtain options through an unbounded user, role, or organizational-unit
list request. Role results shall expose whether a role is currently effective;
organizational-unit results shall expose whether the unit is active. Ineligible
choices shall not be selectable.

Only recipients visible under existing lifecycle, authorization, and
recipient-discovery rules may be selected. This specification does not create a
new privilege or broaden which users, roles, or organizational units a sender
may discover.

The compose form shall reuse the current frontend's existing shared security-
level selector, configured as a required value initialized to Wathiq's lowest
configured level. It shall offer only levels at or below the sender's current
effective clearance. Changing the selected level shall immediately revalidate
every existing recipient selector. A messaging-specific security-level
selector shall not be created.

Recipient search results that are otherwise visible but ineligible at the
selected message level shall remain understandable rather than silently
disappearing. They shall be disabled and display a localized explanation:

- a user does not have sufficient current effective clearance;
- a user is not currently permitted to exchange person-to-person messages;
- a role has no current effective user with sufficient clearance; or
- an organizational unit has no current effective user with sufficient
  clearance.

For role and organizational-unit results, an otherwise eligible selector is
also disabled when expansion contains no active user who has both sufficient
clearance and `messaging.user_messages.exchange`. The explanation shall
distinguish this from a security-level failure without disclosing users the
sender is not allowed to discover.

For an eligible role or organizational unit, the UI may show the current number
of eligible expanded users as a preview. The server's transaction-time expansion
and count remain authoritative because assignments and clearance may change
before send.

When **Action required** is selected, compose shall offer an optional action due
date using the sender's working timezone and explain that it is informational.
Clearing **Action required** clears the due date. A past local date is invalid.

Compose, including an editable draft, shall provide an **Add resources** button
that opens a search-and-selection dialog. The sender shall not have to choose a
resource in a separate dropdown before opening the dialog. The dialog shall:

- use a compact dialog approximately half the available desktop width, while
  remaining usable on narrow screens;
- offer one text box that always uses the existing combined full-text search,
  plus a resource-kind filter with **All** (default), **Aggregations**, and
  **Records**; do not offer a separate number field or full-text checkbox;
- search record numbers, titles, descriptions and indexed component contents,
  and the supported indexed aggregation metadata, through that same search;
- make no search request when the dialog opens, while the sender types, when
  the filter changes, or for a blank query; execute a nonblank query only on
  **Search** or **Enter**, and reset pagination when criteria change;
- show each result with a selection checkbox beside its title, its kind and
  number together below the title, and its description below those identifiers
  when one exists; align these consistently in LTR and RTL;
- show an appropriate record or aggregation icon for every result;
- make the title open an authorized read-only metadata dialog above the picker,
  without navigating away. Lay out metadata in two columns, with the description
  spanning both; collapse to one column on narrow screens. Include the existing digital-content Preview action
  for authorized digital records, but no resource action panel or digital-contents
  section. Closing details or preview returns to the underlying dialog without
  changing the query, filter, page, scroll position, selections or unsaved compose;
- reuse or extend the frontend's shared search and selection components rather
  than introduce a separate messaging search implementation;
- use bounded server-side cursor pagination; changing a search or filter resets the
  result page but retains the sender's selected resources across pages and
  searches, with each resource identified by its kind and ID;
- allow multiple records and aggregations to be selected, show the selection
  in a bounded, independently scrolling list, and allow individual selections
  to be removed before confirmation. Keep the selected count and confirmation
  actions outside that scroll area so adding selections cannot keep growing
  the dialog. Apply the same bounded scrolling to the attached-resources list
  in Compose, with the count and send/save actions outside the scroll area;
- provide an **Add selected** action, disabled when nothing is selected or the
  selection would exceed the remaining configured resource-link limit; and
- allow cancellation without changing the message body or its resource links.

On **Add selected**, revalidate all selected resources against current sender
access and the selected message level. If any selection is invalid or the
combined link count exceeds the limit, explain the problem and keep the dialog
open without partially inserting the selection. On success, add each resource to the separate attachment panel and its
normalized resource-link list, then close the dialog. Never insert resource
titles into the editable message body. For compatibility, the submitted/stored
HTML retains one opaque marker per link; the UI hides these markers and renders
all links in a dedicated panel below the authored body, including older messages. Report lookup and validation failures visibly;
an enabled action must not silently do nothing. Final send-time validation
remains mandatory under MSG-011.

Search results, filters, full-text excerpts, and selection details must obey
the existing search authorization and disclosure rules. A component content
match must not create a direct component link or reveal content the sender
cannot read. A visible
resource whose security level exceeds the selected message level shall be
disabled rather than silently omitted and shall show a localized explanation
that the message level must be at least the resource level. A resource the
sender is not permitted to discover must not be revealed as a disabled result.

If the sender lowers the message level after adding resources or recipients,
every newly invalid selection shall be visibly identified and the send action
shall remain blocked until the sender raises the message level or removes the
invalid selections. Equivalent stable validation reasons shall be returned when
the server rejects a stale or manually constructed request.

The server, not only the UI, shall enforce recipient, content, and field
validation.

### 6.5 Toast notification

When a new recipient copy has committed and the recipient has a connected
Wathiq client, the recipient shall receive a near-real-time toast. The toast
shall provide enough information to identify and open the message without
carrying the full rich-text body. Every currently connected tab and device for
that user shall receive the live event and show the toast.

The toast shall not be treated as proof that the user read the message. Toasts
may be repeated after reconnect or event redelivery; clients shall de-duplicate
them by recipient-copy ID within the current page lifetime.

On initial connection and after every reconnection, the client shall reconcile
with the server for messages newer than its last acknowledged mailbox cursor.
This catch-up is required even when the WebSocket reports a clean connection.
It ensures that a message committed while the client was offline is still
presented and cannot be lost merely because its live signal was missed.

Catch-up never produces one toast per missed message. If catch-up finds one or
more new recipient copies, the client shows at most one localized summary such
as **You have 7 new messages**, updates the unread indicator, and leaves the
individual messages in Inbox. Repeated reconciliation for the same mailbox
cursor must not repeat the summary. After catch-up completes, newly committed
live messages use the normal per-message toast behavior.

The unread counter and inbox shall always be obtained from durable server state,
not calculated solely from toasts received by the current page.

### 6.6 Outbox

The Outbox route and API require `messaging.user_messages.exchange` and shall
list only envelopes sent by the authenticated human user. It
uses server-side pagination and defaults to newest `sent_at` first. It supports
bounded filtering by subject, sent-date range, priority, security level,
action-required state, late/outstanding action state, and recipient selector.

Opening an Outbox item shows the immutable sent message, its selector headers,
the concrete delivery result, requested read receipts, and per-recipient action
status. Current security and resource-link authorization still apply. The
Outbox does not imply that all recipients remain authorized to open the message
or its resources.

For an eligible ordinary user message, the Outbox detail provides **Forward**
and **Send follow-up** actions. Both open a new compose form linked to that
envelope and require the sender to choose and validate a new recipient list;
the original `To`/`Cc` list is not copied into the new draft. Forward uses
relationship kind `forward`; Send follow-up uses `follow_up`. Neither operation
embeds the earlier subject or body. The actions are hidden or disabled with a
clear reason for a test message, amendment notice, inaccessible or purged
message, inactive Outbox reference, inadequate clearance, or absent exchange
privilege.

Outbox shows the configured expiry date and warning state. It exposes
**Delete** only when the sender has a currently retained committed record
capture satisfying MSG-020. A **Recently deleted** view within Outbox lists the
sender's deleted entries still within their restoration period and provides
Restore. Sender deletion never deletes or hides a recipient's delivery.

### 6.7 Drafts

The Drafts route and API require `messaging.user_messages.exchange`. The page
lists only the authenticated user's unsent drafts, newest
updated first, using server-side pagination. It supports opening, editing,
sending, and explicitly discarding a draft. Each row shows last-updated time and
a non-sensitive validation summary such as **Ready to validate on send** or
**Needs attention**.

After the API confirms a successful send, remove that draft from the visible
listing immediately and close its compose panel, then refresh the remaining
listing. Do not wait for the refresh response to remove the sent draft. A failed
send must retain the draft and its editable contents. This keeps the listing
consistent with the committed send even when the subsequent refresh is slow
or fails, and prevents the user mistaking a sent message for an unsent draft.

Drafts are not displayed in Inbox or Outbox and never contribute unread,
receipt, action, or Monitor delivery counts. This revision defines explicit
save and discard; it does not require automatic keystroke-by-keystroke saving.

### 6.8 Sent-message action status

For an action-required envelope, the sender's sent view shall show one status
per concrete To recipient: Outstanding, Late, Completed, Completed late, or
Withdrawn. Cc recipients remain visible for delivery/read receipts but have no
action status and do not contribute to action counts or Outstanding/Late
filter matches. A completion status links to the reply that recorded it. Aggregate
wording may summarize counts, but it must not conceal the per-recipient state
or treat one recipient's completion as completion for all recipients.

The original Outbox detail page contains an **Action status** panel showing the
original and current effective action state, original and effective due date,
per-recipient status, and chronological amendment history. A clearly labelled
**Amend action** button appears beside the current state/due date when the
authenticated user is the original sender, currently has
`messaging.user_messages.exchange`, retains the active Outbox reference and
clearance, the original was action-required, and the action has not been
withdrawn. On narrow layouts the same action may appear in that panel's
overflow menu; it must not be placed only in an unrelated generic message menu.

The Outbox list may show an amended indicator but does not execute an amendment
directly. The sender must open the message first. Selecting **Amend action**
opens a confirmation form showing the immutable original state, current
effective state/date, the permitted add/change/remove/withdraw choices, affected
recipient count, mandatory reason, notification consequence, and resulting
state preview. Server validation is authoritative. After commit, the panel
updates the timeline and derived recipient statuses without altering the
original message fields.

When a completion reply arrives, the sender receives the normal new-message
toast for that reply. The toast may additionally indicate **Action completed**
after the server confirms the sender may view both the reply and original
message; the transient event itself shall not carry protected message details.

### 6.9 Notification Administration

The Notification Administration page follows MSG-019 and uses bounded,
server-paginated producer search rather than loading a complete growing
catalogue. It clearly distinguishes feature-owned locked fields from editable
configuration, shows the active version and operational owner, validates
placeholders and audiences before save, requires a reason, and provides a
non-sending preview. It has deliberate loading, empty, validation-error,
concurrency-conflict, and save-failure states. Any tabular producer/version or
audience presentation uses Wathiq's standard table treatment rather than a raw
default NiceGUI table.

**Send test** opens a confirmation form showing the producer, exact
configuration version, explicit individual recipients, test values, and the
permanent TEST marking. The page also provides bounded, server-paginated test
history with initiator, configuration version, recipient count, time, and
outcome, but not protected message content in the list.

## 7. Database model

PostgreSQL is the authoritative store. UUID primary keys use PostgreSQL `uuid`
values generated by the application or an approved database UUID function.
They are globally unique and opaque to users.

In the tables below, **FK** means foreign key: a database-enforced reference
to another row. **Required** means the value must be present; **nullable** means
it may be absent (`null`) under the stated rules. A **composite key** uses more
than one column to identify a row or enforce a relationship.

### 7.0 Identifier policy

Messaging uses UUIDs for externally referenced messaging objects and Wathiq's
existing identifier conventions for internal rows. It does not replace every
`BIGSERIAL` key with a UUID.

Use a UUID as the sole primary identifier for an envelope, delivery, draft,
action amendment, capture operation, or immutable notification-configuration
version. These IDs are returned to clients and reused in API calls,
relationships, live events, or capture provenance. For example, a client uses
the same draft UUID to retrieve, update, discard, restore, or send that draft;
a capture UUID also appears in its provenance PDF filename.

Internal child and association rows whose own IDs are not exposed in APIs,
events, links, or provenance use the keys specified below: `BIGSERIAL`, an
existing entity's `BIGINT`, a natural text key, or a composite key. Examples
include selectors, resource links, localizations, addressee mappings, and
capture-component mappings. Existing user, role, organizational-unit,
security-level, aggregation, record, and digital-component IDs do not change.

UUIDs provide stable, globally unique identities if data is moved or combined
and avoid exposing adjacent sequence values. Returning an ID through an API
does not itself require a UUID; PostgreSQL sequences already support concurrent
transactions and multiple API instances. The larger storage and index cost of
a 16-byte UUID is accepted only for objects that need this external identity.

Do not add both an internal `BIGSERIAL` key and a UUID alias for the same object
without a separately approved performance design justifying the extra storage
and mapping complexity. Generate UUIDs consistently using the repository's
approved implementation. Identifier format and predictability are not security
controls: every operation still enforces ownership and authorization.

The required tables are:

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `message_envelopes` | Parent row for one immutable send and the fields common to every recipient |
| `message_envelope_localizations` | Immutable rendered system-message or action-amendment-notice subject/body variants by language |
| `message_recipient_selectors` | Immutable user, role, and organizational-unit choices made by the sender |
| `message_addressees` | Immutable expanded concrete-user `To` and `Cc` snapshots |
| `message_mailboxes` | Safe per-user sequence allocation for reconnect catch-up |
| `message_request_receipts` | Minimal send/amendment deduplication keys; no content or recipient list |
| `message_deliveries` | One independently readable inbox copy per recipient |
| `message_action_completions` | One immutable reply-based completion acknowledgment per recipient delivery |
| `message_action_amendments` | Append-only structured corrections to an original action requirement or due date |
| `message_resource_links` | Normalized Wathiq resource references embedded in the shared body |
| `message_drafts` | Private unsent compose state owned by one human user |
| `message_draft_recipient_selectors` | Unsaved-to-envelope user, role, and unit selections for a draft |
| `message_draft_resource_links` | Structured Wathiq resource references in a draft body |
| `message_record_captures` | Auditable link between one capture operation, its selected message, and resulting record |
| `message_record_capture_components` | Ordered mapping for captured-message PDFs and the final provenance PDF |
| `system_notification_producers` | Feature-registered system event and immutable safety contract |
| `system_notification_configuration_versions` | Immutable administrator-authored configuration versions for a registered producer |
| `system_notification_configuration_translations` | Per-language subject/body templates for one notification configuration version |
| `system_notification_configuration_audiences` | Static user, role, unit, or declared dynamic-resolver audience configuration for one version |

No table stores an active WebSocket, frontend-instance ID, or NiceGUI client
object. Those are short-lived process-local connection details.

### 7.1 `message_envelopes`

One row represents one immutable send operation.

| `sent_at` | `timestamptz` | Required; assigned by the server/database |
| `expires_at` | `timestamptz` | Required; derived from `sent_at` and configured retention at send time |
| `sender_deleted_at` | `timestamptz` | Nullable; Outbox entry was deleted, starting its restoration period; human sender only |
| `sender_purge_after` | `timestamptz` | Nullable; required with `sender_deleted_at`; deadline for restoring that deleted Outbox entry, not a guaranteed physical-purge date |
| `request_id` | `uuid` | Required idempotency key for the send request, unique within the sending principal/system producer |

Constraints shall enforce sender-kind, message-kind, amendment-link, and
system-provenance consistency. If `relationship_kind` is null, both related IDs
must be null. A `reply` requires only `related_delivery_id`; a `follow_up`
requires only `related_envelope_id`; and a `forward` requires exactly one of
the two. Relationship source and kind are immutable. The API shall reject an
over-limit subject or body before insertion and shall return a stable
validation reason. The body limit is measured after server-side sanitization so
the stored representation is bounded; an implementation shall also impose a
slightly larger bounded request limit before sanitization to prevent
oversized-input abuse.

For `sender_kind = system`, constraints shall require the configured baseline
security level, `read_receipt_requested = false`, `action_required = false`, and
all action due fields to be null.

An `action_amendment_notice` must have `sender_kind = user`, link exactly one
amendment, use the original envelope's sender, security level, expiry, and
concrete audience, inherit its priority, contain no resource links, and set
`read_receipt_requested = false` and
`action_required = false`. It cannot be a reply, forward, follow-up, or test
message.

Constraints shall permit `is_test = true` only for `sender_kind = system` with a
registered configuration version, test-run ID, and initiating administrator.
They require all test fields to be null for a production message. Test provenance
remains immutable while the envelope exists; independent audit history follows
its own retention rules.

Required envelope content remains populated while the retention group is
stored, including after an individual message's expiry. There is no
`content_purged_at` state or reduced envelope tombstone. Final group purge
physically deletes the envelopes and their dependent message rows under MSG-020.

A constraint shall require all three action due fields to be null when
`action_required = false`, and shall require either all three to be null or all
three to be non-null when `action_required = true`. The server validates that
`action_due_at` is the start of the local date following `action_due_date` in
`action_due_timezone`, including daylight-saving transitions.

`sender_user_id` must not use cascading deletion because deleting a user must
not erase other users' messages. The stored sender name preserves attribution.

#### 7.1.1 `message_envelope_localizations`

This table is empty for an ordinary human-authored `user_message`. For a
`system_notification` or `action_amendment_notice`, it stores the immutable
rendered variants created in the send transaction:

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `envelope_id` | `uuid` | Required FK to `message_envelopes(id)` |
| `language_tag` | `text` | Required normalized FK to the registered language |
| `subject` | `text` | Required rendered non-blank subject under the ordinary subject limit |
| `body_rich_text` | `text` | Required rendered and sanitized body under the ordinary body limit |
| `direction` | `text` | Required send-time language-direction snapshot; `ltr` or `rtl` |
| `rendered_at` | `timestamptz` | Required server-assigned send-transaction time |

The primary key is `(envelope_id, language_tag)`. Rows are immutable and are
purged with the other send-level message data under MSG-020. A constraint or
transactional validation requires the envelope's default `subject` and
`body_rich_text` to equal its system-default-language variant. A system
notification or action-amendment notice is valid only when the same transaction
inserts exactly one variant for every language enabled in the locked language-
registry snapshot; an ordinary user message must have none.

### 7.2 `message_recipient_selectors`

This table records the sender's original choices before recipient expansion.
Separate user, role, and organizational-unit foreign keys identify the target;
there is no generic target ID whose meaning depends on another field.

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `bigserial` | Primary key |
| `envelope_id` | `uuid` | Required FK to `message_envelopes(id)` |
| `recipient_type` | `text` | Required; `to` or `cc` |
| `selector_kind` | `text` | Required; `user`, `role`, `org_unit`, or `everyone` |
| `user_id` | `bigint` | Nullable FK to `users(id)` |
| `role_id` | `bigint` | Nullable FK to `roles(id)` |
| `org_unit_id` | `bigint` | Nullable FK to `org_units(id)` |
| `display_name` | `text` | Required non-blank send-time snapshot |
| `ordinal` | `integer` | Required non-negative display order within its recipient type |

For ordinary selectors, a check constraint shall require exactly one of
`user_id`, `role_id`, or `org_unit_id` to be non-null and to agree with
`selector_kind`. For `everyone`, all three references must be null. Uniqueness constraints shall prevent the same selector from
appearing more than once in the same recipient type. Foreign-key deletion
behavior must preserve sent-message history and the immutable selector display
snapshot even if the referenced user, role, or organizational unit is later
deleted.

### 7.3 `message_addressees`

This table stores one immutable recipient snapshot for each user resolved by
recipient expansion.

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `envelope_id` | `uuid` | Required FK to `message_envelopes(id)` |
| `user_id` | `bigint` | Required FK to the history-preserving user identity row; `ON DELETE RESTRICT` |
| `recipient_name` | `text` | Required non-blank name snapshot |
| `recipient_type` | `text` | Required; `to` or `cc` |
| `ordinal` | `integer` | Required non-negative display order within its recipient type |

The primary key is `(envelope_id, user_id)`. This guarantees that one user
cannot appear twice or in both recipient types. Unique ordering constraints per
envelope and recipient type shall prevent ambiguous order.

### 7.4 `message_mailboxes`

This table provides a committed, per-recipient ordering boundary for catch-up.
Sequence allocation is gap-free; later group purge may leave gaps in the stored
deliveries. Purge never resets or decrements `last_sequence`.

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user_id` | `bigint` | Primary key and FK to the history-preserving user identity row; `ON DELETE RESTRICT` |
| `last_sequence` | `bigint` | Required non-negative latest allocated mailbox sequence |

When a transaction creates a delivery, it locks the recipient's mailbox row,
increments `last_sequence`, and assigns that value to the delivery. For a send
to several users, mailbox rows are locked in ascending user-ID order to avoid
deadlocks. The mailbox increment and delivery commit together.

Only sends to the same recipient must wait for that recipient's mailbox lock.
Sends to unrelated users can proceed concurrently. A cursor `N` therefore means
that every delivery allocated to that user with sequence `<= N` has committed.
A timestamp, UUID, or ordinary database sequence alone must not be used as this
guarantee because allocation order need not equal transaction commit order.

### 7.5 `message_deliveries`

This table is the fan-out and inbox table. Each row is one recipient's own copy.

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `uuid` | Primary key; globally unique recipient-copy/message ID |
| `envelope_id` | `uuid` | Required FK to `message_envelopes(id)` |
| `recipient_user_id` | `bigint` | Required FK to the history-preserving user identity row; `ON DELETE RESTRICT` |
| `recipient_type` | `text` | Required; `to` or `cc`; must agree with the address row |
| `mailbox_sequence` | `bigint` | Required positive per-recipient sequence allocated through `message_mailboxes` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | Required; time the copy was committed |
| `language_tag_at_send` | `text` | Required normalized snapshot of the recipient's effective language used for the live toast |
| `read_at` | `timestamptz` | Nullable; immutable first-read time |
| `deleted_at` | `timestamptz` | Nullable; set by manual deletion or automatic expiry |
| `purge_after` | `timestamptz` | Nullable; required with `deleted_at`; deadline for restoring the deleted entry, calculated using the configured restoration period |
| `deletion_reason` | `text` | Nullable; `user_deleted` or `retention_expired`, required with `deleted_at` |

There is exactly one delivery per `(envelope_id, recipient_user_id)`. A
composite foreign key including recipient type shall require the corresponding
address row and prevent an address/delivery mismatch.
`(recipient_user_id, mailbox_sequence)` is also unique.

Ordinary Inbox queries exclude deleted rows. Recently deleted queries include
only the authenticated user's entries whose deleted-message restoration period
has not ended. At the end of that period, the entry is no longer restorable or
visible through its own mailbox path. Its delivery row remains intact while
the retention group is stored, preserving relationships, sender-visible
receipts, and action status without restoring the recipient's mailbox access.
Read-only access through another authorized linked message follows MSG-020.

For sent Inbox and Outbox entries, restoration before expiry clears the
applicable deletion fields. Restoration after expiry clears `deleted_at` (or
`sender_deleted_at`) and the Inbox deletion reason but preserves `purge_after`
(or `sender_purge_after`) as the final access deadline. Ordinary mailbox queries
may include such a restored expired entry only before that deadline. A later
deletion sets its deletion timestamp again without extending the preserved
deadline. These combinations must be supported by the table constraints.
Draft restoration has its separate fresh-expiry rule in section 7.8.

At group purge, delete all deliveries and addressee rows together. There is no
delivery tombstone state. The composite address/delivery foreign key remains
mandatory while rows exist; the purge transaction must remove dependencies in
a valid order or use deferred constraints. It must not disable integrity checks.

Required indexes include:

- `(recipient_user_id, deleted_at, read_at, created_at DESC, id)` for inbox,
  Recently deleted, and unread work;
- `(recipient_user_id, mailbox_sequence)` for cursor-based catch-up;
- `(envelope_id, recipient_user_id)` for per-recipient send/read status.

The production schema shall include indexes for keyset/cursor pagination that
match the final Inbox query. Offset pagination alone is insufficient for large
mailboxes.

### 7.6 `message_action_completions`

Each row is one recipient's immutable acknowledgment, made through a reply,
that their action is done.

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `original_delivery_id` | `uuid` | Primary key; FK to the recipient's original `message_deliveries(id)` |
| `reply_envelope_id` | `uuid` | Required unique FK to the reply `message_envelopes(id)` |
| `completed_by_user_id` | `bigint` | Required FK to `users(id)`; must equal the original delivery owner at creation |
| `completed_at` | `timestamptz` | Required server-assigned completion instant |

On insertion, validation shall confirm all of the following:

- the new envelope's `relationship_kind` is `reply`;
- its `related_delivery_id` equals `original_delivery_id`;
- the original envelope requires action; and
- the authenticated completing user owns the original delivery, which must
  have `recipient_type = to`.

The completion row and reply deliveries commit atomically. The row is immutable
and cannot be updated or deleted through ordinary messaging operations. Final
retention-group purge deletes it with the original and reply messages.

An index on `(reply_envelope_id)` is supplied by its uniqueness constraint. An
index on `(completed_by_user_id, completed_at DESC)` supports the recipient's
action-status queries. Sender status queries join through the original delivery
and its envelope.

#### 7.6.1 `message_action_amendments`

Each row is one immutable structured amendment to an original action-required
envelope.

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `uuid` | Primary key; globally unique amendment ID |
| `original_envelope_id` | `uuid` | Required FK to the original `message_envelopes(id)` |
| `sequence` | `integer` | Required positive sequence allocated under a lock on the original envelope |
| `amendment_kind` | `text` | Required; `due_date_added`, `due_date_changed`, `due_date_removed`, or `action_withdrawn` |
| `previous_action_required` | `boolean` | Required effective-state snapshot immediately before this amendment |
| `previous_due_date` | `date` | Nullable previous effective local due date |
| `previous_due_timezone` | `text` | Nullable previous validated IANA-timezone snapshot |
| `previous_due_at` | `timestamptz` | Nullable previous effective exclusive late boundary |
| `new_action_required` | `boolean` | Required effective state introduced by this amendment |
| `new_due_date` | `date` | Nullable new effective local due date |
| `new_due_timezone` | `text` | Nullable new validated IANA-timezone snapshot |
| `new_due_at` | `timestamptz` | Nullable new effective exclusive late boundary |
| `reason` | `text` | Required non-blank sender-authored reason; at most 2,000 Unicode characters after NFC normalization and trimming |
| `created_by_user_id` | `bigint` | Required history-preserving FK to the original sender |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | Required server-assigned commit time |
| `request_id` | `uuid` | Required amendment idempotency key, unique for the original sender |

`(original_envelope_id, sequence)` is unique. Constraints require each kind's
previous/new fields to form exactly the transition allowed by MSG-023, with due
triples either wholly null or wholly populated. The original envelope and its
latest amendment are locked while deriving the next state and sequence, so two
concurrent requests cannot create conflicting histories. Rows cannot be
updated or individually deleted through messaging operations.

Exactly one `action_amendment_notice` envelope references each committed
amendment through `message_envelopes.action_amendment_id`. The amendment and
notice are committed in the same transaction. The foreign-key arrangement may
be deferred within that transaction, but no committed amendment may exist
without its notice or vice versa.

Action amendments remain intact while their retention group is stored. Final
group purge deletes amendments, their notices, and the original envelopes in
the same transaction; it leaves no amendment tombstones. Request deduplication
follows section 8.

### 7.7 `message_resource_links`

This table normalizes each Wathiq resource link embedded in the envelope body so
the server can validate it at send time and re-evaluate it without parsing rich
text on inbox-render paths.

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `bigserial` | Primary key |
| `envelope_id` | `uuid` | Required FK to `message_envelopes(id)` |
| `link_token` | `uuid` | Required opaque token referenced by the sanitized body; unique within the envelope |
| `ordinal` | `integer` | Required non-negative body order |
| `resource_kind` | `text` | Required; `record` or `aggregation` |
| `target_id_snapshot` | `bigint` | Required immutable original target ID for diagnostics without granting access |
| `aggregation_id` | `bigint` | Nullable FK to `aggregations(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL` |
| `record_id` | `bigint` | Nullable FK to `records(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL` |
| `security_level_id_at_send` | `bigint` | Required FK to `security_levels(id)`; immutable validation/audit snapshot |

On insert, validation shall require exactly one target foreign key to be
non-null, to agree with `resource_kind`, and to equal `target_id_snapshot`. A
later target deletion sets the live foreign key to null while preserving the
link row as an unavailable historical reference. Direct digital-component
links are not supported. Supporting another Wathiq resource kind requires an explicit schema column, foreign key,
security-level resolution rule, and authorization rule; a generic unchecked
polymorphic target ID must not be introduced.

The current resource level and permission are authoritative when listing or
opening the message. `security_level_id_at_send` documents the successful
send-time check but is not an authorization cache. Required indexes support
lookup by `(envelope_id, ordinal)` and by each non-null target foreign key.

Ordinary sanitized external hyperlinks may remain in the rich-text body but do
not become Wathiq resource links. Internal aggregation and record URLs must
use a normalized resource-link row. A raw internal digital-component URL must
not bypass the supported-kind restriction; reject it rather than treat it as an
external hyperlink. Apply the same restriction to drafts and final sends,
including manually constructed API requests.

No existing human messages or component links require compatibility handling
for this revision. Remove component targets from message and draft link storage
and validation rather than retaining a legacy-link path. This does not remove
digital components from records or from message-to-record capture: the PDF
components and provenance mappings in section 7.9 remain required.

### 7.8 Draft tables

`message_drafts` stores one private unsent compose document:

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `uuid` | Primary key; stable draft identifier exposed through client APIs |
| `owner_user_id` | `bigint` | Required FK to `users(id)`; only this user may access the draft |
| `subject` | `text` | Nullable while saved; required for send; send-time limit applies |
| `priority` | `text` | Required; same controlled values as envelopes |
| `body_rich_text` | `text` | Nullable while saved; send-time sanitation and size limits apply |
| `security_level_id` | `bigint` | Required FK to `security_levels(id)`; defaults to the lowest configured level |
| `action_required` | `boolean` | Required |
| `action_due_date` | `date` | Nullable draft value subject to send-time validation |
| `action_due_timezone` | `text` | Nullable validated IANA working-timezone snapshot paired with a due date |
| `read_receipt_requested` | `boolean` | Required |
| `relationship_kind` | `text` | Nullable draft value; `reply`, `forward`, or `follow_up` |
| `related_delivery_id` | `uuid` | Nullable source-delivery UUID for an Inbox source; validated on use, not an FK |
| `related_envelope_id` | `uuid` | Nullable source-envelope UUID for an Outbox source; validated on use, not an FK |
| `version` | `bigint` | Required positive optimistic-concurrency version |
| `date_created` | `timestamptz` | Required |
| `date_updated` | `timestamptz` | Required |
| `expires_at` | `timestamptz` | Required; derived from the last update and configured active period |
| `deleted_at` | `timestamptz` | Nullable; set on expiry or explicit discard |
| `purge_after` | `timestamptz` | Nullable; required with `deleted_at`; deadline for restoring the deleted entry, calculated using the configured restoration period |
| `deletion_reason` | `text` | Nullable; `expired` or `discarded`, required with `deleted_at` |

`message_draft_recipient_selectors` mirrors the selector kind, foreign-key,
recipient type, display snapshot, and ordering structure of
`message_recipient_selectors`, but belongs to a draft. It creates no concrete
addressee or delivery rows.

`message_draft_resource_links` mirrors the normalized target and body-token
structure of `message_resource_links`, but its validation status is advisory
until send. Current resource authorization and security are always rechecked.

An unsent draft never prevents purge of a sent retention group. Its source
UUIDs are saved compose references, not foreign keys that retain sent messages.
Every source read and send revalidates availability and authorization. If the
source group has been purged, show an unavailable-source state and reject send;
do not silently remove the relationship or recreate the source message.

Draft edits use optimistic concurrency. A successful draft send locks the
draft, validates its version and ownership, creates the complete envelope and
fan-out transaction, and deletes the draft rows only as part of the same
successful commit.

Ordinary Drafts queries exclude rows with `deleted_at`; Recently deleted drafts
include only the owner's unpurged deleted rows. Restoring clears the deletion
fields, advances the optimistic-concurrency version, and calculates a new
active expiry from the restoration time. Permanent purge removes child rows in
the same transaction.

### 7.9 Message-to-record capture tables

`message_record_captures` records one successful capture:

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `uuid` | Primary key |
| `selected_envelope_id` | `uuid` | Nullable live FK to `message_envelopes(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL` |
| `selected_envelope_id_at_capture` | `uuid` | Required immutable source-envelope UUID; survives source-message purge |
| `record_id` | `bigint` | Nullable current FK to `records(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`; unique while present |
| `record_id_at_capture` | `bigint` | Required immutable record-ID snapshot used for provenance after governed record disposition |
| `captured_by_user_id` | `bigint` | Required FK to `users(id)` with history-preserving behavior |
| `captured_by_name` | `text` | Required immutable capturing-user display-name snapshot |
| `captured_at` | `timestamptz` | Required server-assigned instant |

`message_record_capture_components` records each generated PDF:

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `bigserial` | Primary key; internal capture-component mapping identifier |
| `capture_id` | `uuid` | Required FK to `message_record_captures(id)` |
| `component_kind` | `text` | Required; `message` or `provenance` |
| `envelope_id` | `uuid` | Nullable live FK to the captured `message_envelopes(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`; null for provenance |
| `envelope_id_at_capture` | `uuid` | Immutable source-envelope UUID; required for a message component and null for provenance |
| `digital_component_id` | `bigint` | Nullable current FK to `digital_components(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`; unique while present |
| `digital_component_id_at_capture` | `bigint` | Required immutable component-ID snapshot used for provenance after governed disposition |
| `component_order` | `integer` | Required positive order matching the committed component |
| `is_selected_message` | `boolean` | Required; true only for message component 1 |

Constraints require exactly one provenance component per capture, with null
`envelope_id` and `envelope_id_at_capture`, `is_selected_message = false`, and
the greatest component order. At capture commit, live envelope IDs must equal
their immutable capture snapshots and identify existing authorized messages.
Group purge clears only the live FKs; it never changes the snapshots, PDFs,
records, or component order. A partial unique `(capture_id, envelope_id_at_capture)` constraint for message components prevents duplicate
message PDFs. A unique `(capture_id, component_order)` constraint preserves
deterministic ordering. `record_id_at_capture` and
`digital_component_id_at_capture` remain uniquely associated with their capture
provenance even after governed deletion nulls the current foreign key. Capture
rows and the authoritative record and components are written in the
record-draft commit transaction, not when PDFs are merely staged.

### 7.10 System notification administration tables

`system_notification_producers` stores the feature-owned allowlist:

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `producer_code` | `text` | Primary key; stable code registered by application feature code |
| `feature_code` | `text` | Required owning feature/module identifier |
| `event_type` | `text` | Required immutable backend event type |
| `required_for_business_commit` | `boolean` | Required immutable feature policy; true means the registered event and its durable notification must commit together |
| `contract_version` | `integer` | Required positive code-contract version |
| `contract_definition` | `jsonb` | Required code-owned, schema-validated declaration of placeholders, audience modes, and resource-link kinds; contains no executable expression |
| `active_configuration_version_id` | `uuid` | Nullable FK to an immutable version belonging to this producer |

Application startup or migration reconciliation may add or advance a producer's
feature-owned contract, but administrator requests cannot insert a producer or
alter its feature-owned fields.

`system_notification_configuration_versions` stores immutable administrator
configuration:

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `uuid` | Primary key |
| `producer_code` | `text` | Required FK to `system_notification_producers` |
| `version` | `integer` | Required positive version unique within the producer |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | Required; must be true when the producer has `required_for_business_commit = true` |
| `subject_template` | `text` | Required bounded canonical English/default template using only declared placeholders |
| `body_template_rich_text` | `text` | Required bounded canonical English/default sanitized template using only declared placeholders |
| `priority` | `text` | Required; `normal`, `high`, or `very_high` |
| `audience_mode` | `text` | Required; `static` or an allowlisted dynamic resolver code |
| `resource_presentation` | `jsonb` | Required schema-validated, non-executable configuration restricted by the producer contract |
| `operational_owner` | `text` | Required non-blank team or owner label |
| `change_reason` | `text` | Required non-blank reason |
| `created_by_user_id` | `bigint` | Required history-preserving FK to the administrator |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | Required server-assigned time |

`system_notification_configuration_translations` stores one template pair per
configuration version and enabled language:

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `configuration_version_id` | `uuid` | Required FK to the immutable configuration version |
| `language_tag` | `text` | Required normalized FK to the registered language |
| `subject_template` | `text` | Required non-blank bounded template |
| `body_template_rich_text` | `text` | Required non-blank bounded sanitized template |
| `review_status` | `text` | Required; `draft`, `reviewed`, or `published`; only `published` is activation-eligible |
| `reviewed_by_user_id` | `bigint` | Required history-preserving FK for an activation-eligible translation |
| `reviewed_at` | `timestamptz` | Required for an activation-eligible translation |

The primary key is `(configuration_version_id, language_tag)`. Exact named-
placeholder parity with the canonical template is required. The default-
language row must exactly equal the canonical columns; storing it in the child
table makes coverage and language iteration uniform.

`system_notification_configuration_audiences` stores the ordered static
audience selectors for a version using explicit nullable foreign keys for user,
role, and organizational-unit kinds, the same exactly-one-target constraint as
message selectors, and `to`/`cc` classification. It is empty for a dynamic
resolver configuration. Dynamic resolver codes come only from the producer
contract and are not stored as administrator-authored query text.

Activating a version updates the producer pointer and records its event-history
and Security Operations entry in one transaction. Versions referenced by sent
envelopes cannot be changed or deleted. Configuration APIs use optimistic
concurrency so two administrators cannot silently overwrite one another.

### 7.10A `message_request_receipts`

A request receipt prevents a retry of an old send from recreating a message
after its conversation has been purged. It is one small operation record, not
an envelope or a recipient copy. It is never readable through mailbox APIs and
has no foreign key to a message or delivery. It stores no subject, body,
recipient list, or delivery IDs.

| Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `bigserial` | Internal primary key; not exposed to clients |
| `operation_kind` | `text` | Required; `send` or `amendment` |
| `principal_user_id` | `bigint` | Required history-preserving user FK for a human operation; null for a system producer |
| `producer_code` | `text` | Registered producer FK for a system send; null for a human operation |
| `request_id` | `uuid` | Required original idempotency key |
| `request_fingerprint` | `text` | Required digest of the canonical request, not a copy of its content |
| `source_event_type` | `text` | Required for a production system send; otherwise null |
| `source_event_id` | `text` | Required for a production system send; otherwise null |
| `result_envelope_id` | `uuid` | Required immutable result UUID snapshot; notice-envelope UUID for an amendment; not an FK |
| `result_amendment_id` | `uuid` | Required only for an amendment; immutable UUID snapshot, not an FK |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | Required server-assigned successful-operation time |
| `result_purged_at` | `timestamptz` | Null until the result's retention group is physically purged |

Exactly one of `principal_user_id` and `producer_code` must be populated.
Amendments require a human principal. Unique constraints cover operation kind,
principal, and request ID; production system sends also have a unique producer,
source-event type, and source-event ID. System test sends use their distinct
request keys and do not reserve a production domain-event identity.

The receipt is inserted atomically with the successful send or amendment.
Failed transactions leave no receipt. All fields except `result_purged_at` are
immutable; group purge sets that field in the same transaction that deletes the
result messages. Receipts remain to enforce the existing no-duplicate-send
contract after purge. This retains one small row per successful operation,
not one row per recipient, and does not imply that all operational metadata
has a bounded lifetime. Receipt storage shall be included in capacity planning.

### 7.11 Why the model is separated

The envelope prevents one copy of a large rich-text body per recipient while
preserving one immutable send operation. A human message stores one authored
body; a system message stores one rendered body per enabled language rather
than per recipient. The selector table preserves exactly what the sender placed
in the `To` and `Cc` headers. The addressee table records the fixed list of
resolved users. The delivery table supplies the required globally unique copy
ID and isolates read state for each recipient. The resource-link table permits
bounded live authorization checks without duplicating or reparsing message
content. The completion table records the one permitted per-recipient action
acknowledgment without adding workflow state to the message envelope.

This is preferable to putting one `is_read` flag on a shared message row, which
cannot represent multiple recipients correctly.

## 8. Send transaction and idempotency

### 8.1 Send transaction

The server shall process a send as one database transaction:

1. authenticate the human sender, or authenticate and authorize the registered
   internal system producer; a human sender must currently have
   `messaging.user_messages.exchange`;
2. for a human sender, resolve current effective clearance and validate the
   selected message level against it; for a system producer, force the current
   lowest configured level without accepting a requested level;
3. validate and normalize the user, role, and organizational-unit selectors;
4. validate the reply, forward, or follow-up relationship, the sender's right
   to use its delivery or Outbox-envelope source, and the referenced message's
   security-level floor; when the reply marks an action
   done, also lock and validate the original recipient delivery and confirm no
   completion already exists;
5. for a human message, sanitize and validate the authored subject/body; for a
   system message, validate complete published template coverage and render and
   sanitize every enabled-language variant from the same typed context;
6. resolve every structured Wathiq resource link and verify that the resource
   exists, the sender may read it, and its current security level is not above
   the message level;
7. resolve all selectors to active, sufficiently cleared concrete users using
   one transaction snapshot; for a human message require each concrete user to
   have `messaging.user_messages.exchange`; apply `To` precedence and enforce
   post-expansion recipient limits;
8. reject any direct user below the required clearance and any role or
   organizational-unit selector having no eligible expanded user;
9. insert one envelope and, for a system message, all immutable rendered
   language variants;
10. insert all selector, expanded-address, and normalized resource-link
    snapshots;
11. lock recipient mailbox rows in stable order and allocate each recipient's
    next mailbox sequence;
12. insert one delivery copy per address with the recipient's effective-
    language snapshot;
13. when requested, insert the action-completion row linking the original
    recipient delivery to the new reply envelope;
14. issue one PostgreSQL `NOTIFY` per delivery on Wathiq's dedicated message
    notification channel, carrying only the delivery ID, recipient user ID, and
    mailbox sequence; and
15. commit once, causing PostgreSQL to release the notifications only after
    the message rows have committed.

No toast or event shall be emitted before the transaction commits.

### 8.2 Retries and idempotency

The caller shall supply one stable idempotency key for each intended send and
reuse it when retrying that send. The server shall check and reserve the key
through `message_request_receipts` in the send transaction. Concurrent retries
of the same operation must produce one committed result. Reusing the key with
different request content shall fail as a conflict. Compare the canonical
caller request, not a freshly expanded audience or other mutable directory
state.

While the result's retention group exists, an authorized retry returns the
original envelope and recipient-copy IDs. After group purge, an authenticated,
authorized retry by that same principal returns `410 Gone` with stable reason
code `message_result_purged`; it never creates another envelope, regenerates
delivery IDs, or returns protected content. Different-content reuse still
fails as a conflict. The internal system-producer service returns an equivalent
already-processed/result-purged outcome without repeating the notification.

For a system notification, its registered producer and domain-event identity
form this stable idempotency key. A retry of the causing business operation
does not invent a new notification key.

The send response shall identify the envelope and the recipient-copy IDs so the
result of fan-out is explicit and traceable.

### 8.3 Action-amendment transaction

An action amendment uses a separate atomic transaction:

1. authenticate the original human sender and verify current exchange
   privilege, active Outbox ownership, and clearance;
2. lock the original envelope and its latest amendment, derive the current
   effective state, and reject an informational, withdrawn, purged, expired,
   deleted, or otherwise inaccessible original;
3. validate the requested transition, reason, future boundary, and every
   fairness rule in MSG-023 against current completion rows;
4. allocate the next amendment sequence and insert the immutable amendment
   using the caller's idempotency key;
5. render and sanitize every enabled-language amendment-notice variant from
   server-owned catalogue templates; fixed labels are localized while the
   sender-authored reason is preserved verbatim;
6. create the linked amendment-notice envelope using the original sender,
   security level, expiry, concrete recipients, and `To`/`Cc` classifications;
7. allocate recipient mailbox sequences, create one delivery per original
   recipient, and issue the ordinary post-commit `NOTIFY` wake-up signals; and
8. commit the amendment, notice, variants, and deliveries together.

An amendment uses the same request-receipt rules, with operation kind
`amendment`. A retry returns the existing result while its group remains;
after group purge it returns `message_result_purged` without recreating the
amendment or notice. Reuse with a different requested transition or reason
fails as a conflict. Failure before commit leaves neither an amendment, a
notice, nor a request receipt.

## 9. Frontend-neutral real-time architecture

### 9.1 Separation of responsibilities

The backend messaging service owns message storage, addressing, authorization,
read state, catch-up, PostgreSQL notification handling, and the real-time event
contract. It shall not depend on NiceGUI classes, page objects, Socket.IO client
IDs, or UI state.

Every frontend integrates through two backend contracts:

1. the authenticated REST API for sending, inbox queries, reading, receipts,
   and cursor-based catch-up; and
2. an authenticated real-time stream that emits small versioned events such as
   `message_available`.

The first public real-time transport shall be an authenticated WebSocket. The
same versioned event contract shall subsequently be made available over
server-sent events as the fallback transport. Clients prefer WebSocket and may
fall back to SSE when WebSocket establishment or continued operation is not
available. Authentication, authorization, cursor reconciliation, reconnect
behavior, and event meaning are identical across both transports. Because the
server only pushes availability hints, neither transport replaces ordinary
REST writes.

### 9.2 Portable live-event contract

A `message_available` event shall contain only safe routing and reconciliation
information, for example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "event_type": "message_available",
  "delivery_id": "e483330f-82e4-49d1-8ed0-513b1fdd84b2",
  "mailbox_cursor": 81724
}
```

It shall not contain the rich-text body or a recipient list. The authenticated
connection is bound server-side to its principal; a client cannot subscribe by
supplying another user's ID. On receipt, the client uses the REST API to fetch
authorized state and update its presentation.

Events are versioned independently of NiceGUI or Flutter. Unknown event types
or later schema versions shall not crash a client; the client shall fall back
to mailbox reconciliation.

### 9.3 Multiple API instances

All API instances point to the same authoritative PostgreSQL database. A send
accepted by API instance A commits the envelope, deliveries, mailbox sequences,
and `NOTIFY` calls in one transaction. PostgreSQL emits each notification only
after that transaction commits. API instance A does not attempt to locate
recipient connections itself.

Every API instance that hosts real-time gateway connections maintains a
dedicated PostgreSQL connection which executes `LISTEN` on Wathiq's message
notification channel. PostgreSQL broadcasts each notification to all currently
listening gateway instances. Each instance keeps only its own in-memory map from
authenticated user ID to connections. On a notification:

- an instance with one or more connections for the recipient pushes the event
  to those connections;
- an instance without such a connection ignores it; and
- no instance needs to know which load-balancer target owns the recipient.

Consequently, a sender connected through API A can reach a recipient connected
through API B, C, or any later instance.

```text
Sender
  -> API instance A
  -> PostgreSQL transaction
       envelope + addressees + per-user sequence + deliveries + NOTIFY
  -> PostgreSQL broadcasts after commit
       -> API gateway A -> connections owned by A
       -> API gateway B -> connections owned by B -> recipient
       -> API gateway C -> connections owned by C
  -> recipient fetches authorized message state from any API instance
```

### 9.4 PostgreSQL notification channel

PostgreSQL `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` is the required internal broadcast wake-up
mechanism for this revision. Every real-time gateway instance maintains its own
`LISTEN` session, so PostgreSQL broadcasts the notification to all currently
listening instances. The notification carries only the delivery ID, recipient
user ID, and mailbox sequence; consumers read authoritative message state
through the service/database path.

This channel is needed because live connections are process-local. If API
instance A commits a message while the recipient's connection belongs to API
instance B, instance B otherwise has no immediate way to know about the commit
except repeated database polling. `NOTIFY` supplies that prompt without adding
another service.

`LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` is transient and has a listener-startup race. It shall never
replace the delivery tables or catch-up API. A gateway that starts or reconnects
first establishes its listener and then requires every client connection it
currently owns to reconcile from that client's durable mailbox cursor before
depending on new notifications. This closes both the listener-startup race and
a gap caused by a temporary database-listener disconnection while end-user
connections stayed open.

The listener shall use bounded reconnection backoff, expose its health, and
avoid holding an open transaction while waiting for notifications. The
notification channel is internal deployment infrastructure. It does not turn
messaging into an external user-delivery channel: users still receive messages
only inside authenticated Wathiq clients.

The listener connection shall be opened directly for the lifetime of the API
worker or gateway process and shall not be checked out from the ordinary
request database pool. A pooled connection cannot safely remain reserved for
`LISTEN`, and returning a listening session to the pool could leak subscription
state into unrelated requests. Each process therefore budgets one separate
listener connection, closes and recreates it on shutdown/reconnect, and includes
that connection in PostgreSQL `max_connections` capacity planning. Ordinary API
queries and send transactions continue to use the bounded request pool.

### 9.5 Multiple NiceGUI instances

A NiceGUI frontend is an adapter, not the messaging service. Each NiceGUI
instance may maintain authenticated subscriptions to the backend real-time API
for the users whose pages it currently hosts. When it receives
`message_available`, it uses supported NiceGUI APIs to show `ui.notify(...)`
through NiceGUI's existing Socket.IO/WebSocket connection.

This provides two separate hops:

```text
backend real-time API -> NiceGUI adapter -> NiceGUI browser connection
```

The first hop is the Wathiq frontend-neutral contract. The second is a NiceGUI
implementation detail. The NiceGUI instance does not need direct database
access for messaging and does not use NiceGUI's private Socket.IO internals as
a cross-service notification channel.

An alternative browser adapter may connect directly to the backend real-time
API when Wathiq's authentication and deployment topology support that choice.
Either form shall produce the same inbox and read behavior.

Existing load-balancer affinity remains necessary for NiceGUI's own live page
state. It is not used to route inter-user messages between instances.

### 9.6 Future Flutter or other clients

A Flutter client connects directly to the same authenticated REST API and
real-time stream. It maps `message_available` to a Flutter in-app presentation
and then fetches/reconciles the recipient copy through the REST API. No NiceGUI
protocol, Socket.IO event, or Python page object appears in the mobile contract.

This specification defines in-app foreground/reconnect behavior only. Mobile
operating-system push notifications while the application is suspended or
terminated would be an external delivery channel and require a separate
approved specification.

### 9.7 Reconnection and missed signals

When any client or frontend adapter connects or reconnects, it shall call a
bounded catch-up endpoint using its last durable mailbox cursor. The server
returns committed recipient copies after that cursor. Missing sequence values
left by group purge are normal and do not require tombstones. Each page returns
a safe continuation cursor: it must not advance past an eligible delivery
omitted by the page limit. Once the snapshot has no more eligible deliveries,
it may advance to that snapshot's committed mailbox high-water mark, including
when all intervening deliveries were purged. Catch-up must not return deleted
or expired entries merely because their group still exists. The only expiry
exception is an explicitly restored entry still within its preserved
restoration deadline under MSG-020. The client updates its unread indicator
and, when new copies exist, displays only the single reconnect summary defined
in section 6.5 rather than individual missed-message toasts.

Therefore:

```text
PostgreSQL rows = durable messages
LISTEN/NOTIFY + real-time stream = fast availability hints
catch-up query = recovery from every missed hint
frontend adapter = presentation only
```

No correctness guarantee shall depend on one API instance, one frontend
instance, NiceGUI live page state, notification replay, or a client
acknowledging a toast.

### 9.8 Back-pressure and privacy

Connections, outbound event buffers, listener reconnect delays, and catch-up
pages shall be bounded. A slow client must not block an API event loop or cause
an unbounded per-connection queue. The gateway may disconnect a slow client,
which then recovers through catch-up.

The server shall re-check the authenticated user before returning message
content. The durable inbox remains available even when the PostgreSQL
notification listener, real-time gateway, or frontend adapter is unhealthy.

## 10. API responsibilities

Exact endpoint names may follow the repository's API conventions. The API
shall provide all the authenticated operations below.

### 10.1 Recipient and resource selection

- validate user, role, and organizational-unit recipient selectors and return
  the committed expanded-recipient count;
- provide bounded recipient-selector search without returning complete
  tenant-grown collections;
- provide bounded, authorization-filtered record and aggregation search,
  including existing metadata filters and full-text search, for the multi-select
  dialog; validate its structured links against the selected message level;
- reject digital-component targets in resource selection, draft resource links,
  and send requests, including raw internal component URLs;
- list selectable message security levels at or below the current sender's
  effective clearance;
- return stable, localized reason codes when a recipient selector is
  ineligible for the selected message security level.

### 10.2 Sending, relationships, and action status

- send a human-authored message with an idempotency key only when the
  authenticated user has `messaging.user_messages.exchange`;
- send a reply that may atomically acknowledge completion of the authenticated
  recipient's own action-required delivery;
- start and send a forward from either an authorized Inbox delivery or an
  active, authorized Outbox envelope owned by the authenticated sender;
- start and send a follow-up linked to an active, authorized Outbox envelope
  owned by the authenticated sender;
- append one permitted action amendment to an original sent envelope, using an
  idempotency key, and return the resulting amendment and notice identities;
- return the ordered action-amendment history and effective action state as
  part of authorized original-message and Outbox-detail responses;
- return per-recipient Outstanding, Late, Completed, Completed late, or
  Withdrawn action status for the original sender and the applicable recipient;
- resolve/open reply, forward, and follow-up links only when the requester owns
  the linking delivery or sent the linking envelope, and may read the referenced
  message under the applicable relationship grant, current clearance,
  retention-group access rules in MSG-020, and resource rules.

### 10.3 Mailboxes, drafts, and restoration

- list the current user's inbox using server-side cursor pagination and
  filters, returning system messages only when exchange privilege is absent;
- get one current-user recipient copy;
- mark one current-user copy read, idempotently;
- return non-disclosing message and resource-link availability state for the
  bounded current inbox page using batched authorization evaluation;
- list and get the authenticated human user's Outbox with server-side
  pagination and authorized per-recipient status;
- create, list, get, update with optimistic concurrency, send, and discard only
  the authenticated user's own drafts;
- list the authenticated user's active and recently deleted Inbox and Outbox
  references, return expiry state, perform capture-gated or explicitly capture-
  free early deletion under MSG-020, and restore during the deleted entry's
  restoration period;
- list the current sender's sent envelopes and per-recipient receipt status;
- get a sent envelope created by the current sender.

### 10.4 Record capture

- initialize a message-capture record draft only for an eligible human-authored
  message whose complete relationship chain is also eligible, stage the ordered
  generated PDFs, and commit capture provenance with the ordinary record
  transaction.

### 10.5 Notification administration and monitoring

- list registered notification producers and preview, version, activate, enable,
  or disable only their permitted configuration fields for callers with
  `messaging.notifications.administer`;
- create, review, publish, validate, and preview notification templates per
  enabled language with exact placeholder parity;
- send and list bounded, explicitly marked notification tests under MSG-019 for
  callers with `messaging.notifications.administer`;
- return sanitized messaging operational health only to callers with
  `messaging.monitor`.

### 10.6 Real-time events and catch-up

- obtain a bounded catch-up page after a mailbox cursor;
- establish an authenticated, versioned real-time event stream.

### 10.7 Authorization and sender boundaries

There is no generic message-edit endpoint. The API shall reject reply,
forward, completion, and independent record-capture operations whose target is
an amendment notice. Opening such a notice resolves its linked original only
after the ownership, exchange-privilege, clearance, retained-group link-access,
and resource checks in MSG-020.

For a system envelope, Inbox, message view, toast preparation, and capture APIs
select the immutable language variant under MSG-021. They must not perform
runtime machine translation or return all variants unless an explicitly
authorized administration operation needs them.

System producers shall use the internal application-service boundary in
MSG-018, not a public request field that lets an ordinary user claim to be
`system`. The ordinary client send endpoint always creates a user message
attributed to its authenticated human sender. Domain APIs may cause only their
registered backend notification events; they must not expose a generic
client-controlled system-send proxy.

Specifically, production feature code uses the internal Python
`emit_system_notification` application-service contract in MSG-018. It is not
mounted as a REST route. The only HTTP operation that directly initiates a
system envelope is the privilege-gated, immutable test-send route in MSG-019,
which cannot create a production envelope.

Authorization shall be derived from the authenticated principal. Inbox
requests must not accept another user's ID as a way to select mailbox
ownership.

## 11. Reliability and operations

### 11.1 Delivery guarantee

Once the send transaction commits, each recipient copy is durable and
queryable even if every real-time connection is disconnected. PostgreSQL
notifications are transient wake-up signals and can be missed during a listener
disconnect. Duplicate UI signals are also possible after reconciliation, so
consumers must be idempotent. Catch-up is the required recovery path. The
system does not claim exactly-once toast or banner display.

### 11.2 Failure behavior

- A database failure before commit returns failure and creates no partial send.
- A PostgreSQL listener or notification-routing failure after commit does not
  roll back or lose the message.
- A WebSocket, database-listener, or gateway failure does not change inbox or
  read state.
- An API or frontend restart may lose live connections or page objects, but
  reconnection catch-up restores mailbox state from PostgreSQL.
- A failed read-state request remains unread until the server commits it; the
  UI shall reconcile instead of assuming success.

### 11.3 Monitoring

Operational health shall report, without exposing message content:

- PostgreSQL notification count emitted by the send path;
- notification count received by each gateway instance;
- listener connection and reconnect count by instance;
- time of each listener's last received notification;
- active real-time connections by instance, without user-identifying labels;
- slow-client disconnect count;
- catch-up request failures;
- active listener health;
- atomic system-notification failure count and processing latency by producer
  code, without subject, body, recipient, or resource content;
- separate test-send count, failure count, rate-limit rejection count, and
  processing latency by producer code;
- messages approaching retention expiry, active or restorable mailbox entries, purge
  candidates, content purged, cleanup failures, and oldest unprocessed eligible
  purge, without message or recipient content;
- retention-group size, expired messages retained by later group members,
  group-purge duration/failures, and groups delayed by size or repeated cleanup
  failures, without exposing participants or message content.

Logs shall include request/correlation IDs, envelope ID, delivery ID, and safe
status metadata. They shall not include rich-text bodies or protected linked
resource data.

### 11.4 Retention and user deletion

Sent-message expiry, per-user mailbox deletion, deleted-message restoration,
whole-group purge, and record preservation follow MSG-020. Draft lifecycle
follows MSG-016. The messaging subsystem has no separate legal-hold mechanism:
information requiring governed retention must be saved as a record, after which
the record copy is governed by the existing record rules. Record disposition
never deletes a still-retained source message, and message expiry never deletes
the captured record.

Permanent deletion of a user shall not cascade to envelopes, addressee
snapshots, deliveries, receipts, or messages that user sent to other people.
Historical sender and recipient names and identifiers needed to understand the
communication remain in immutable snapshots while the retention group is
stored; they are deleted with that group. Foreign-key handling must preserve
the message history while preventing a deleted account from authenticating or
receiving new messages. Inactive and suspended users likewise remain visible in
historical message snapshots but are not selectable for new sends.

If the current user-deletion workflow would physically remove a referenced
`users` row, it shall instead retain a minimal non-authenticating identity
tombstone for referential integrity after removing credentials, assignments,
active profile state, and other data not required by an approved historical
contract. The message snapshots—not the tombstone's mutable profile—remain the
source for historical display. Messaging foreign keys use deletion restriction
and never cascade into retained message history. This user-identity rule is
separate from deleted-message restoration and does not authorize message or
delivery tombstones after group purge.

### 11.5 Deployment-configurable limits

The following limits are environment variables with validated startup defaults:

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `MESSAGING_MAX_SELECTORS_PER_SEND` | `100` | Combined `To` and `Cc` user, role, and organizational-unit selectors |
| `MESSAGING_MAX_RECIPIENTS_PER_SEND` | `2000` | Distinct concrete recipients after expansion |
| `MESSAGING_MAX_RESOURCE_LINKS` | `50` | Structured Wathiq resource links in one message |
| `MESSAGING_DRAFT_ACTIVE_DAYS` | `180` | Inactivity period before a draft expires |
| `MESSAGING_DRAFT_WARNING_DAYS` | `30` | Warning interval before draft expiry |
| `MESSAGING_DRAFT_RECOVERY_DAYS` | `30` | Restoration period for a deleted draft after expiry or discard |
| `MESSAGING_CAPTURE_MAX_LINKED_MESSAGES` | `100` | Earlier linked messages allowed in one record capture |
| `MESSAGING_CAPTURE_MAX_PDF_BYTES` | `52428800` | Combined generated-PDF limit of 50 MiB |
| `MESSAGING_RETENTION_DAYS` | `1095` | Sent-message retention period of three years |
| `MESSAGING_RETENTION_WARNING_DAYS` | `90` | Advance warning before automatic expiry |
| `MESSAGING_DELETION_RECOVERY_DAYS` | `30` | Restoration period for a deleted Inbox or Outbox entry; physical deletion waits for the whole retention group |
| `MESSAGING_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `3600` | Interval between retention/draft cleanup runs |
| `MESSAGING_CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE` | `500` | Candidate-discovery page size; never permits splitting a retention group during purge |
| `MESSAGING_TEST_MAX_RECIPIENTS` | `10` | Explicit individual recipients allowed for one test send |
| `MESSAGING_TEST_SENDS_PER_HOUR` | `20` | Test sends allowed per initiating administrator in a rolling hour |
| `MESSAGING_TEST_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | Retention period for unmistakably marked test messages |

The existing environment names containing `RECOVERY` mean deleted-message or
deleted-draft restoration periods; they do not concern account recovery.
`purge_after` and `sender_purge_after` likewise mark entry-restoration deadlines,
not guaranteed dates of physical group deletion.

Missing variables use these defaults. Non-integer, zero, negative, internally
inconsistent, or administratively unsafe values shall fail application startup
with a clear configuration error rather than silently changing behavior. Every
API and worker instance in one deployment must use identical effective values.
Limits relevant to compose or capture are returned by an authenticated
capabilities endpoint; clients do not read environment variables directly.
Changing a value requires restarting the affected instances. An increase is a
capacity and abuse-risk change and requires performance verification rather
than being treated as an unrestricted administrator preference. Retention and
deleted-entry restoration values are snapshotted into new rows; changing an
environment value does not silently shorten or lengthen already stored expiry
dates or restoration deadlines. Applying a retention change retrospectively
requires a separate deliberate, audited migration or administration operation.

## 12. Security requirements

- Every operation requires authentication, including live connection
  registration and reconnection catch-up.
- Inbox, Outbox, and Drafts derive ownership exclusively from the authenticated
  principal; no request parameter may select another user's mailbox or draft
  owner.
- The Monitor route and API require `messaging.monitor`; that privilege grants
  sanitized operations data only and never grants message-content access.
- Notification Administration requires
  `messaging.notifications.administer`. Server-side contract validation prevents
  that privilege from creating producer events, sending messages, expanding
  feature-declared capabilities, or accessing ordinary mailboxes. Its only
  direct-send authority is the bounded, immutable, individually addressed test
  operation in MSG-019.
- The server derives mailbox ownership and sender identity from the
  authenticated principal.
- Human-message send, reply, forward, follow-up, Compose, Drafts, and Outbox operations
  require `messaging.user_messages.exchange`. Human recipient resolution also
  requires the concrete recipient to have that privilege. System-message
  delivery and system-only Inbox access do not.
- Without exchange privilege, object-level authorization hides existing human-
  authored Inbox, Outbox, and Draft content without deleting it. UUID knowledge
  or a stale live event cannot bypass that restriction.
- No client credential or request body may select `system` as sender. System
  sender identity requires a registered in-process/service producer and its
  allowlisted event contract; a client-triggered domain action retains its
  authenticated actor in provenance.
- System producer contracts grant no general ability to choose arbitrary
  recipients, templates, resource links, security levels, or messaging fields.
- Recipient discovery follows existing user visibility and lifecycle rules.
- The server derives sender and recipient clearance from current effective
  roles; a request-supplied clearance number is never trusted.
- Secured-message content, headers, and links require a fresh clearance check
  on every retrieval, including retrieval through a reply, forward, or
  follow-up.
- A live event and restricted inbox placeholder must not disclose protected
  message metadata before the clearance check succeeds.
- Read, reply, forward, follow-up, sent-status, and receipt operations enforce
  object-level authorization server-side. An Outbox relationship source must be
  owned by the authenticated original sender and have an active Outbox
  reference; a client-supplied envelope UUID alone grants nothing.
- Delete and restore operations apply only to the authenticated user's own Inbox
  or Outbox reference. Early deletion requires that user's committed record-
  capture provenance and cannot be satisfied by another user's capture, except
  that a recipient may delete their own system-notification or amendment-notice
  delivery without record capture because those kinds cannot be captured.
- Action completion can be created only through an authenticated reply by the
  owner of the original delivery; request-supplied user, completion time, late
  state, or ownership values are never trusted.
- Rich text is sanitized server-side and rendered safely.
- Resource links run target authorization on every open.
- Resource links are permitted only when the target's current security level is
  at or below the message level, both when composed and in the send transaction.
- Authorization changes after delivery must fail closed: a restricted message
  exposes only its generic placeholder, and an unavailable resource link
  exposes no protected target metadata.
- UUIDs are identifiers, not authorization secrets.
- Message bodies and recipient lists are sensitive application data and shall
  not be placed in ordinary logs, metrics, or live-event channels.
- Rate and size controls shall bound send operations, recipient counts,
  catch-up pages, and inbox pages. Subject and body limits are fixed in section
  7.1; configurable send and capture limits are fixed by section 11.5.
- Message-to-record capture independently enforces current message access and
  the existing `record.create`, destination `aggregation.add_record`, clearance,
  and record-creation rules. A generated PDF is not an authorization bypass.

## 13. Internationalization and accessibility

All user-visible messaging UI text shall follow the Wathiq internationalization
specification and catalogue workflow. User-authored subjects and bodies are not
catalogue strings and shall be displayed as authored.

System-generated subjects and bodies follow MSG-021's versioned
notification-template and rendered-variant model. Action-amendment notices use
the governed UI-catalogue templates and immutable rendered variants specified
there. They are not generated dynamically by the UI catalogue and are never
machine-translated at delivery or read time. The administration page's labels,
validation explanations, review states, TEST indicator, and fallback notices
remain ordinary UI catalogue strings.

The compose, inbox, message view, priority indicators, action-required state,
toasts, and unread counter shall work in LTR and RTL. Priority and read state
must not be communicated by color alone. Toasts and unread changes shall be
available to assistive technology without unexpectedly moving keyboard focus.

## 14. Verification and acceptance criteria

### Functional

- **AC-MSG-001:** A system producer can send a message displayed with sender
  `system`.
- **AC-MSG-001A:** No public client request can claim the `system` sender or
  directly supply arbitrary system-message content or recipients.
- **AC-MSG-001B:** An authorized client domain action may cause only the
  registered backend notification associated with its successfully committed
  business outcome; rejected and no-op actions create no success notification.
- **AC-MSG-001C:** When an enabled producer attempts a direct system
  notification, the domain transaction and durable notification commit
  together, or neither commits.
- **AC-MSG-001D:** Retrying the idempotent causing business operation after an
  atomic failure creates at most one domain change and one system envelope.
- **AC-MSG-001E:** A system producer cannot exceed its registered event,
  template, audience, field, resource-link, or baseline-security contract.
- **AC-MSG-002:** A user can send to multiple `To` and `Cc` recipients.
- **AC-MSG-003:** A send to N recipients creates N distinct globally unique
  delivery IDs and one shared immutable envelope.
- **AC-MSG-003A:** A role selector expands only to active users for whom the
  selected role is currently effective.
- **AC-MSG-003B:** An organizational-unit selector expands only to active users
  with an effective role directly owned by that active unit and does not
  implicitly include descendant units.
- **AC-MSG-003C:** Overlapping user, role, and organizational-unit selectors
  create one delivery per concrete user, with `To` taking precedence over
  `Cc`.
- **AC-MSG-003D:** Membership changes after commit do not change the selector,
  expanded-address, delivery, or receipt rows of the sent message.
- **AC-MSG-004:** Reading one copy does not change another copy.
- **AC-MSG-005:** A reply links to the earlier delivery ID without copying its
  body. A new reply prefills an editable `Re: [original subject]`; reopening
  a saved reply preserves its saved subject. Priority defaults to Normal and
  security starts at the original level, with the server enforcing its floor.
- **AC-MSG-006:** An Inbox forward links to the earlier delivery ID and an
  Outbox forward links to the earlier envelope ID, without copying its body.
- **AC-MSG-007:** Requested read receipts expose first-read status to the
  sender; unrequested receipts do not.
- **AC-MSG-008:** Resource links re-run target authorization and do not grant
  access.
- **AC-MSG-008A:** A resource above the selected message security level is
  disabled with an explanation and is rejected by the server if submitted.
- **AC-MSG-008B:** Lowering the compose message level identifies every now-
  invalid resource and recipient and blocks send until corrected.
- **AC-MSG-008C:** Raising a resource above the message level or revoking a
  recipient's target permission after delivery makes that link non-clickable
  and non-disclosing without hiding otherwise readable message content.
- **AC-MSG-008D:** A recipient who loses message clearance retains a correctly
  ordered restricted placeholder that reveals none of the protected message
  metadata; sufficient restored clearance restores the ordinary row.
- **AC-MSG-008E:** Inbox availability evaluation is bounded to the current page
  and performs no per-message or per-link network/database round trip.
- **AC-MSG-008F:** Add resources opens the dialog without a prior selection.
  The sender can search, filter, page, and retain multiple record and aggregation
  selections across searches. All is the default kind filter; Aggregations and
  Records restrict the same combined full-text search. There is one query box,
  no separate number field or full-text toggle, and no request before explicit
  nonblank Search/Enter. Cancel changes neither body nor resource links.
  Result cards show a checkbox beside the linked title, type and number together,
  and the description when present. Each result has a record/aggregation icon. Details open in a read-only metadata
  overlay with an authorized Preview button and no action panel or component
  section. Closing it retains the picker page, scroll position, selections and
  unsaved Compose dialog. The compact
  dialog and result alignment work in both English and Arabic.
- **AC-MSG-008G:** A full-text hit in indexed component contents selects the
  containing record. Aggregation search uses its supported metadata. Search
  results and excerpts disclose only information the sender may read.
- **AC-MSG-008H:** Add selected adds the entire valid selection to the separate resources
  panel without inserting titles in the editable body. Empty selections cannot be submitted; stale access, changed
  security levels, lookup failures, and exceeded link limits receive visible
  feedback without partial insertion. Final send repeats authorization checks.
- **AC-MSG-008I:** No digital-component option is offered. Direct component IDs
  and raw internal component URLs are rejected for drafts and sends. Record
  component access and message-to-record PDF capture continue to work.
- **AC-MSG-009:** Unsafe rich text cannot execute in another user's client.
- **AC-MSG-009A:** A subject longer than 255 Unicode characters after NFC
  normalization and trimming is rejected with a stable validation error.
- **AC-MSG-009B:** A sanitized rich-text body larger than 65,536 UTF-8 bytes is
  rejected with a stable validation error, and oversized unsanitized requests
  are bounded before sanitization.
- **AC-MSG-010:** Concurrent and repeated sends with the same principal and
  idempotency key create one envelope and fan-out. After its group is purged,
  replay returns `message_result_purged` and creates nothing. Different-content
  reuse conflicts both before and after purge. Equivalent system-event and
  amendment retries are verified, including receipt rollback on failure.
- **AC-MSG-010A:** Every message has a non-null security level. A user sender
  defaults to the lowest configured level and may select a level at or below
  their greatest current effective-role level, but cannot select a higher one.
- **AC-MSG-010AA:** A system producer always creates the message at the lowest
  configured security level and cannot submit or cause a higher level.
- **AC-MSG-010B:** A secured message cannot include or expand to a user whose
  greatest current effective-role level is below the message level.
- **AC-MSG-010C:** Role and organizational-unit selectors with zero cleared
  users are disabled with the applicable explanation and are rejected by the
  server if submitted directly.
- **AC-MSG-010D:** An eligible group selector delivers only to its cleared
  expanded users, while overlap still produces one copy per concrete user.
- **AC-MSG-010E:** Losing sufficient clearance after delivery prevents content
  retrieval without deleting the delivery; restored clearance restores access.
- **AC-MSG-010F:** A reply, forward, or follow-up cannot lower the security
  level below its referenced message, and its recipients can open the complete
  linked message only while they have sufficient current clearance.
- **AC-MSG-010G:** An action-required message may have a non-past local due date;
  a non-action message cannot retain due fields, and all viewers use the same
  stored `action_due_at` boundary.
- **AC-MSG-010H:** Replying to an incomplete action-required To delivery prompts
  with an unchecked completion control; checking it atomically creates the
  reply and exactly one completion acknowledgment owned by that recipient.
- **AC-MSG-010I:** A user cannot complete another recipient's action, complete
  through a non-reply message, or create a second completion for the same
  delivery.
- **AC-MSG-010J:** Before the due boundary an incomplete delivery is
  Outstanding; after it the sender and that recipient both see Late without a
  stored late boolean.
- **AC-MSG-010K:** A completion before/on the boundary displays Completed; a
  completion after it displays Completed late, and neither state completes
  another recipient's delivery.
- **AC-MSG-010L:** The original sender receives the durable reply and live toast
  and can open the reply from the corresponding per-recipient completion status.
- **AC-MSG-010M:** The Messages drawer category appears immediately below
  Records Management with Inbox always present; Outbox and Drafts gated by
  `messaging.user_messages.exchange`; and independently privilege-gated Monitor
  and Notification Administration in the specified order.
- **AC-MSG-010N:** A human user's Outbox shows each envelope they sent once,
  without duplicating content per recipient, and exposes only authorized
  recipient receipt/action status.
- **AC-MSG-010O:** A draft is private to its owner, creates no delivery or live
  event, uses optimistic concurrency, and converts atomically into exactly one
  sent envelope.
- **AC-MSG-010P:** The Monitor page/API requires `messaging.monitor`, exposes no
  message or recipient content, and does not become accessible through
  `audit.view` alone.
- **AC-MSG-010Q:** An authorized sender or recipient can initialize an ordinary
  record draft only from an eligible human-authored message; unauthorized or
  ineligible message kinds and unauthorized destination access fail without
  staged authoritative content.
- **AC-MSG-010R:** Message capture sets the record's initial title, originated
  date, and security level as specified, produces the selected message as PDF
  component 1, and produces each unique linked earlier message as a subsequent
  PDF ordered by sent time and ID, followed by exactly one provenance PDF as
  the final digital component.
- **AC-MSG-010S:** Capture is atomic at record commit, preserves structured
  resource links without granting resource access, stores matching structured
  and human-readable provenance, and rejects inaccessible linked messages,
  provenance mismatches, or corrupt reference cycles.

### Reliability and real time

- **AC-MSG-011:** A connected recipient receives a near-real-time toast without
  repeated mailbox polling.
- **AC-MSG-012:** Disconnecting a client during send and reconnecting later
  still reveals the committed message through catch-up.
- **AC-MSG-013:** Restarting any API instance, PostgreSQL listener, or frontend
  instance after commit does not lose the message.
- **AC-MSG-014:** Interrupting and restoring a gateway's PostgreSQL `LISTEN`
  connection causes its still-connected clients to reconcile without message
  loss.
- **AC-MSG-014A:** Each gateway process uses one dedicated direct PostgreSQL
  listener connection outside the request pool; listener failure or prolonged
  lifetime cannot exhaust or contaminate pooled request connections.
- **AC-MSG-015:** Duplicate live events do not create duplicate database rows
  or incorrect unread counts.
- **AC-MSG-016:** A failed fan-out creates either all recipient copies or none.
- **AC-MSG-017:** With multiple API and NiceGUI instances, a send accepted by
  one API instance notifies a recipient connected through every other eligible
  instance, without shared in-process connection state.
- **AC-MSG-018:** Starting a gateway during concurrent sends and interrupting
  its database notification subscription does not create a permanent
  notification gap;
  cursor catch-up finds every committed delivery.
- **AC-MSG-019:** The same versioned live event can be consumed by a non-NiceGUI
  test client without importing or emulating NiceGUI or Socket.IO internals.

### Security, scale, and UI

- **AC-MSG-020:** A user cannot read or mark another user's recipient copy.
- **AC-MSG-021:** A user cannot impersonate `system` or another sender.
- **AC-MSG-022:** Inbox, sent items, catch-up, and recipient lookup remain
  bounded and server-paginated with a large test dataset.
- **AC-MSG-023:** Slow or disconnected real-time clients do not create
  unbounded gateway memory growth or delay durable sends.
- **AC-MSG-024:** Toast, inbox, compose, and message view are verified in both
  LTR and RTL in a live browser.
- **AC-MSG-025:** Maintained-language catalogue coverage and required artifact
  checks pass for every new user-visible UI string.
- **AC-MSG-026:** Direct search and group expansion never select an inactive or
  suspended user, and a human sender never receives their own message through a
  direct or expanded selector.
- **AC-MSG-027:** Exceeding the configured selector, concrete-recipient, or
  structured-resource-link limit rejects the complete send without truncation;
  every instance reports and enforces the same effective configuration.
- **AC-MSG-028:** A system message cannot request a read receipt, require an
  action, carry an action due date, or create an action acknowledgment.
- **AC-MSG-029:** Every connected tab and device receives a live toast, while a
  reconnect with any number of missed messages produces at most one summary and
  never one toast per missed message.
- **AC-MSG-030:** WebSocket and subsequent SSE fallback clients consume the same
  authenticated event contract and recover through the same mailbox cursor.
- **AC-MSG-031:** A draft expires after configured inactivity, remains visible
  only to its owner during the deleted draft's restoration period, restores
  without trusting stale authorization, and is permanently purged after that interval.
- **AC-MSG-032:** Message-to-record capture rejects more than the configured
  linked-message or combined-PDF limit without committing a partial record.
- **AC-MSG-033:** Every captured message and provenance component validates as
  PDF/A-2u and PDF/UA-1, preserves applicable LTR/RTL reading order and Unicode
  text, and uses its specified non-sensitive filename.
- **AC-MSG-034:** Deleting, suspending, or deactivating a user neither deletes
  historical messages nor removes immutable sender, selector, or recipient
  snapshots; the account cannot receive new messages.
- **AC-MSG-035:** Before retention expiry, a user can delete only their own
  Inbox or Outbox reference and only after their committed capture of that
  eligible human message as a record; another user's mailbox remains unchanged.
  System-notification and amendment-notice deliveries are capture-free early-
  deletion exceptions because they are ineligible for record capture.
- **AC-MSG-036:** Each message expires on its own configured date, regardless
  of capture. Expiry warnings and deleted-entry restoration periods work for
  both Inbox and Outbox. Restoring an expired entry does not extend its original
  restoration deadline; at that deadline it becomes unavailable through its
  mailbox path. Early deletion does not shorten group retention. Expiry and
  group purge never delete a captured record.
- **AC-MSG-037:** A linear or branched retention group is purged only after every
  member has expired and no entry is active or restorable. A later reply,
  forward, follow-up, or amendment notice delays purge for the entire group.
  No member is independently content-purged. The final transaction physically
  deletes all group envelopes, deliveries, localizations, selectors, addressees,
  resource links, completions, and amendments, leaving no message tombstones.
- **AC-MSG-037A:** Authorized links from active or restorable mailbox entries
  can read expired/non-restorable earlier messages while the group exists.
  Clearance and resource revocation still apply. Group membership does not
  expose sibling branches, another user's mailbox state, or sources for new
  sends that are otherwise ineligible.
- **AC-MSG-037B:** Group purge racing with a send, amendment, restoration, draft
  send, or capture either observes the committed dependency/state change or
  completes first and causes the conflicting operation to fail safely. Fault
  injection at each purge boundary leaves the whole group intact after rollback;
  multiple workers cannot partially or concurrently purge the same group.
- **AC-MSG-037C:** A saved draft does not block source-group purge and cannot be
  sent with its now-missing source. Captured records and PDFs remain unchanged;
  live source FKs become null while immutable captured UUIDs remain correct.
- **AC-MSG-037D:** Catch-up crosses gaps left by group purge without delivery
  tombstones, skipped eligible messages, or a reset mailbox counter. Empty pages
  advance safely to the snapshot high-water mark. Merely retained expired
  entries are excluded; explicitly restored entries obey their final deadline.
- **AC-MSG-037E:** A group larger than the cleanup page size is discovered with
  bounded memory and purged atomically without splitting the group. Size,
  retries, duration, and delayed-group metrics are verified. Request receipts
  contain no message content, recipient list, or delivery IDs after purge.
- **AC-MSG-038:** Only `messaging.notifications.administer` can change a
  registered producer's configuration, and it cannot create events, triggers,
  executable expressions, undeclared placeholders, or direct system sends.
- **AC-MSG-039:** A system notification uses exactly one immutable active
  configuration version; a later administration change does not modify its
  content, audience snapshot, or provenance.
- **AC-MSG-040:** Notification configuration changes require a reason, use
  optimistic concurrency, and create event-history and Security Operations
  entries without protected event data.
- **AC-MSG-041:** A privileged test send traverses the canonical durable send
  and real-time path, permits only bounded explicit active individual
  recipients, and cannot invoke a configured or dynamic production audience.
- **AC-MSG-042:** Test envelopes, toasts, Inbox rows, message views, and
  administration history derive an unmistakable accessible TEST label from the
  immutable `is_test` field; editing subject or placeholder data cannot remove
  it.
- **AC-MSG-043:** Test messages cannot request receipts or actions, be replied
  to, forwarded, followed up, or captured as records; they are separately metered,
  rate-limited, and audited. They expire after the configured test retention
  period and are purged after their deleted-entry restoration periods end under
  MSG-020.
- **AC-MSG-044:** There is no production system-send REST route. An approved
  feature explicitly calls the internal Python application service with its
  open transaction, registered producer code, stable event ID, typed context,
  and actor provenance only.
- **AC-MSG-045:** The internal service rejects caller-supplied content,
  recipients, security level, sender, or undeclared context; it alone loads the
  locked configuration, resolves the approved audience, renders content, and
  invokes canonical fan-out.
- **AC-MSG-046:** Startup readiness detects missing, duplicate, unknown, or
  incompatible producer definitions. When
  `required_for_business_commit = true`, the producer cannot be disabled and a
  durable-notification creation failure rolls back the same domain transaction;
  when false, administrators may disable it and the business operation may then
  commit without a notification.
- **AC-MSG-047:** Activating a system-notification configuration requires one
  published, non-blank, placeholder-compatible template for every enabled
  language; adding a language fails release readiness until coverage exists.
- **AC-MSG-048:** One system send stores one immutable rendered variant per
  enabled language, not per recipient; toast uses the delivery's send-time
  language and later reads use the viewer's current language with deterministic
  fallback and no runtime machine translation.
- **AC-MSG-049:** User-authored subject/body content is never automatically
  translated, while surrounding UI remains localized through the ordinary
  catalogue.
- **AC-MSG-050:** Without `messaging.user_messages.exchange`, a person sees and
  counts only system messages in Inbox and cannot access Compose, Outbox,
  Drafts, send, reply, forward, or follow-up through UI or API.
- **AC-MSG-051:** A human-authored direct or expanded audience excludes users
  without exchange privilege, while a registered system audience may include
  them subject to all system-message rules.
- **AC-MSG-052:** Revoking exchange privilege hides rather than deletes prior
  human Inbox, Outbox, and Draft data; restoring it restores currently retained
  and otherwise authorized data.
- **AC-MSG-053:** An action amendment never updates the original envelope; it
  appends the next structured sequence row, and only add/change/remove due date
  or irreversible withdrawal is accepted for an originally action-required
  message.
- **AC-MSG-054:** An informational message cannot become action-required, a
  withdrawn action cannot be reactivated, and no amendment changes content,
  priority, security, recipients, resources, receipt settings, references, or
  completion acknowledgments.
- **AC-MSG-055:** Adding or changing a deadline requires a future boundary and
  cannot make an incomplete recipient immediately/retroactively Late or change
  Completed to Completed late; extending or removing a corrected deadline
  removes the obsolete late characterization.
- **AC-MSG-056:** The amendment, all enabled-language notice variants, the
  specialized notice envelope, original-audience deliveries, mailbox sequences,
  and wake-up notifications commit atomically and idempotently, or none do.
- **AC-MSG-057:** Every original recipient receives one amendment notice with
  their original `To`/`Cc` classification, original security level and expiry;
  the notice cannot be replied to, forwarded, followed up, completed, tested,
  or captured independently and opens the authorized original message.
- **AC-MSG-058:** Only the original sender with current exchange privilege,
  active Outbox ownership, and adequate clearance may amend, using the Outbox
  detail's Action status panel and mandatory reason form; there is no generic
  sent-message edit operation.
- **AC-MSG-059:** Concurrent amendments serialize into an unambiguous sequence,
  and retrying one amendment key creates neither a duplicate amendment nor
  duplicate recipient notices.
- **AC-MSG-060:** Original-message and Outbox views derive the same effective
  action state from ordered history; completion replies always target the
  original delivery, and withdrawal affects only incomplete recipients.
- **AC-MSG-061:** Capturing an original message includes the amendment history
  and effective state existing at capture time without a separate notice PDF;
  a later amendment never rewrites a previously committed record.
- **AC-MSG-062:** Amendment-notice fixed text is rendered for every enabled
  language at commit while its user-authored reason remains verbatim, and its
  localized UI strings pass the ordinary maintained-language catalogue checks.
- **AC-MSG-063:** An eligible Outbox detail offers Forward and Send follow-up;
  each creates a new immutable envelope linked by `related_envelope_id` and
  never embeds or copies the earlier subject or body.
- **AC-MSG-064:** Starting an Outbox forward or follow-up does not inherit the
  earlier recipients; the sender must choose a new `To`/`Cc` audience that
  passes all current recipient, clearance, and resource validations.
- **AC-MSG-065:** A reply uses only an Inbox delivery source, a follow-up uses
  only an owned active Outbox-envelope source, and a forward uses exactly one
  of those source types; malformed, foreign, deleted, restricted, test, or
  amendment-notice sources are rejected server-side.
- **AC-MSG-066:** A recipient of an Outbox-originated forward or follow-up can
  open the linked earlier message only through their own linking delivery and
  while current clearance, MSG-020 retained-group link access, and resource
  authorization permit it, including when the earlier message has expired;
  knowing either UUID alone grants no access.
- **AC-MSG-067:** Message-to-record capture accepts only
  `message_kind = user_message`; it rejects a production or test system
  notification, an action-amendment notice, or a relationship chain containing
  either kind without staging or committing a partial record.
- **AC-MSG-068:** In each frontend, every messaging user, role, organizational-
  unit, and security-level selector is that frontend's established corresponding
  component configured for the messaging context, not a messaging-specific copy
  or fork. WebUI and Flutter are verified independently against their own
  component systems; no cross-framework UI-component sharing is required, and
  server-side messaging validation remains authoritative.
- **AC-MSG-069:** Schema verification confirms that externally referenced
  messaging domain objects use their specified UUID identities, internal child
  and association rows retain the specified `BIGSERIAL`, existing `BIGINT`,
  text, or composite keys, and no duplicate UUID alias is added without a
  separately approved performance design.

Database-backed verification shall use a new uniquely named disposable
PostgreSQL database for each run, initialize it from the required canonical
schema or migration path, point the complete test process only at that
database, and drop it after the run whether tests pass or fail.

## 15. Comparison with email and chat messaging

This section is explanatory rather than a source of additional functional
requirements. Wathiq messaging is a governed internal communication channel;
it is not intended to reproduce every capability of email or conversational
chat.

| Consideration | Wathiq messaging | Email | Chat messaging |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary purpose | Governed internal notifications and durable person-to-person messages connected to Wathiq work | Universal asynchronous correspondence within and outside an organization | Rapid, conversational collaboration |
| Reach | Active Wathiq users; external delivery belongs to the separate email extension | Nearly universal across organizations and platforms | Usually members or guests of the same chat service or workspace |
| Identity | Authenticated Wathiq identity with immutable sender and recipient snapshots | Address-based identity whose assurance depends on mail-domain and authentication controls | Service/workspace identity, often strong within one tenant |
| Authorization after delivery | Message clearance and resource authorization are checked again whenever content or a linked resource is opened | A delivered copy is normally outside the sender application's continuing control | Varies by product; copied, exported, or downloaded content may escape later access changes |
| Security classification | Mandatory message security level enforced against senders, recipients, groups, and linked resources | Classification may be expressed through labels or gateway policy but is not universally enforced end to end | Often workspace-policy driven, with capabilities varying by service |
| Delivery durability | PostgreSQL is authoritative; live events are hints and reconnect catch-up recovers missed events | Store-and-forward delivery is mature but crosses independently administered servers | Usually durable within the service, although retention may be channel- or workspace-specific |
| Immediacy | Near real time for connected clients, without repeated polling | Asynchronous; push speed depends on mail servers and clients | Typically the strongest option for immediate conversation, presence, and rapid exchanges |
| Conversation model | Individual immutable envelopes linked by reply, forward, or follow-up relationships | Mature reply, forwarding, and thread conventions, with inconsistent behavior between clients | Channels, group threads, direct messages, reactions, presence, and typing indicators are common |
| Changes after sending | Original messages are immutable; narrowly defined action amendments preserve correction history | Recall and replacement are unreliable across systems; recipients usually retain the original | Many products permit editing or deletion, sometimes with limited history visibility |
| Actions and receipts | Governed read receipts, informational due dates, per-recipient completion acknowledgments, and fairness-preserving amendments | Delivery/read receipts are inconsistent and may be rejected or disabled | Read indicators and lightweight tasks vary by product and are often less formal |
| Wathiq resources | Structured links preserve identity and re-run Wathiq authorization on every open | Links or attachments can be copied externally and may become stale or overexposed | Links can be convenient but are generally not part of the target system's governed message model |
| Attachments | Core subsystem intentionally has no arbitrary file attachments; Wathiq resources remain controlled links | Strong support for attachments, although copies become difficult to govern | Strong support for files and media, subject to the chat service's controls |
| Records Management | A message chain and provenance can become a governed Wathiq record with archival PDFs | Emails can be captured, but reliable classification and preservation commonly require a separate integration | Chat capture is often difficult because relevant context is distributed across channels, edits, reactions, and threads |
| System notifications | A business change and its required durable notification can commit atomically in the same database transaction | Delivery requires an external mail system and cannot normally share the business transaction | Usually requires an external chat API and service availability |
| Offline and external access | Requires an authorized Wathiq client and eventual connection to Wathiq | Excellent offline-client support and external reach | Depends on the chat client and service; often good on mobile devices |
| Portability | Frontend-neutral Wathiq APIs support NiceGUI, Flutter, and future clients, but the protocol is application-specific | Open, widely interoperable standards and a broad client ecosystem | Commonly proprietary APIs and service-specific clients |

### 15.1 Advantages of Wathiq messaging

Compared with ordinary email or chat, Wathiq messaging provides:

- one authoritative authenticated identity and permission model;
- mandatory security classification enforced at selection, send, list, and
  open time;
- continuing authorization checks for linked Wathiq resources instead of
  distributing uncontrolled resource copies;
- immutable messages, recipient snapshots, amendment history, and capture
  provenance suitable for later audit;
- atomic system notifications tied to successful backend business changes;
- independent delivery, read, and action status for every concrete recipient;
- direct conversion into a governed Wathiq record using accessible archival
  PDFs; and
- durable delivery without requiring an external mail or chat provider.

These characteristics make it particularly suitable for internal notices and
communications whose meaning depends on Wathiq permissions, security levels,
resources, business events, or records-management obligations.

### 15.2 Disadvantages and deliberate limitations

Compared with email, Wathiq messaging:

- does not reach a person who lacks an active Wathiq account in the core
  subsystem;
- does not provide universal addressing, federation, or access through ordinary
  mail clients;
- cannot provide an out-of-band alert when a user is not using a Wathiq client;
- does not support arbitrary attachments; and
- requires Wathiq to operate and monitor the database, APIs, live gateways,
  clients, retention jobs, and PDF-capture path.

Compared with chat, Wathiq messaging:

- is less suitable for rapid back-and-forth conversation;
- deliberately omits rooms, group conversations, presence, typing indicators,
  reactions, calls, and informal media sharing;
- makes corrections more formal because a sent envelope is immutable; and
- may feel heavier when the participants need temporary collaboration rather
  than a durable, attributable communication.

Near-real-time delivery also depends on a connected client. A disconnected
user receives the message durably on their next connection but receives no
external notification from the core subsystem. PostgreSQL `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`
and cursor catch-up keep the initial operational design simple, but a future
deployment with exceptionally large fan-out or connection volume may need a
dedicated event-distribution service without changing PostgreSQL's role as the
authoritative message store.

### 15.3 Appropriate channel selection

Wathiq messaging should be preferred for governed internal notifications,
security-sensitive communication, messages linked to Wathiq resources,
action-required correspondence, and communication that may need to become a
Wathiq record.

Email remains more appropriate when the recipient is outside Wathiq, universal
interoperability is required, or the recipient needs delivery through an
ordinary mail client. Such delivery belongs to the separately specified
external-email extension and carries different security risks and controls.

Chat remains more appropriate for informal, high-frequency team discussion,
presence-aware coordination, and collaborative conversation that does not need
each contribution to function as an individually governed message. Important
decisions or evidence arising in chat may still need deliberate capture into
Wathiq through a separately governed process.

The channels are therefore complementary. Wathiq messaging should not be
presented as a universal replacement for either email or chat.

## 16. Phased implementation and verification plan

Implementation shall use the following five phases. The phases follow the
architecture's dependency order and create independently testable boundaries;
they are not permission to expose incomplete behavior. A phase is complete only
when its assigned requirements have implementation and verification evidence.

```text
Durable kernel -> Human messaging -> Real-time distribution
                                      |
                                      v
                            System notifications
                                      |
                                      v
                    Records and production hardening
```

### 16.1 Phase 1 — Durable messaging kernel

This phase establishes the PostgreSQL and backend foundation used by every
sender and frontend.

It shall implement:

- the complete canonical schema and corresponding upgrade migration, including
  the hybrid identifier policy in section 7.0;
- the canonical transactional envelope and fan-out service;
- immutable envelopes, selectors, expanded addressees, deliveries, mailbox
  sequences, resource links, drafts, completions, amendments, and transactional
  request-deduplication receipts;
- recipient expansion, deduplication, `To` precedence, eligibility, clearance,
  security-level, resource-link, and message-size validation;
- rich-text sanitization, idempotency, snapshotting, stable mailbox ordering,
  and complete transactional rollback; and
- bounded frontend-neutral APIs for recipient/resource lookup, send, Inbox,
  Outbox, message retrieval, read state, and cursor catch-up.

The validation gate shall initialize a new disposable database from
`database/schema.sql`, separately upgrade a disposable database through the
migration, compare the resulting structures, and test concurrency, mailbox
ordering, idempotency, fan-out rollback, selector expansion, authorization,
sanitization, resource security, and bounded pagination. Every database-backed
run shall use and subsequently drop a uniquely named disposable database.

The exit condition is that a human message can be committed, fanned out exactly
once per eligible recipient, retrieved after process restart, and reconciled by
cursor without relying on WebSocket, NiceGUI, or other process memory.

### 16.2 Phase 2 — Complete human messaging

This phase builds the human-facing workflows on the durable kernel. It shall
implement the Messages navigation, Compose, Inbox, Outbox, Drafts, privilege
enforcement, read receipts, reply, Inbox and Outbox forwarding, Outbox follow-
up, structured resource links, priorities, security levels, action-required
messages, due dates, completion replies, immutable action amendments, and
amendment notices.

Each frontend shall reuse its own established user, role, organizational-unit,
and security-level selectors under MSG-005A. The UI shall include deliberate
loading, empty, restricted, validation, concurrency-conflict, and failure
states. It shall not use unbounded tenant collection requests.

The validation gate shall cover object-level API authorization, drafts and
optimistic concurrency, all relationship kinds, security floors, independent
recipient state, receipts, action status, due boundaries, completion,
amendment fairness, withdrawal, amendment concurrency, and idempotency. WebUI
shall be verified in a live browser in both LTR and RTL, including shared-
selector regression checks, repeated navigation, background-task abandonment,
and freshness after mutation. Translation catalogue coverage, ordering,
placeholder, provenance, and hash checks shall pass.

The exit condition is that every human workflow assigned to this phase behaves
correctly through the frontend and remains correct after refresh or process
restart. This is a validation milestone, not authorization for production
release: Phase 3 must supply live delivery and reconnect behavior, and Phase 5
must complete the human message's records and retention lifecycle.

### 16.3 Phase 3 — Real-time and multi-instance distribution

This phase adds low-latency presentation without moving correctness out of
PostgreSQL. It shall implement post-commit `NOTIFY`, one dedicated direct
listener connection outside each gateway's request pool, the versioned
frontend-neutral event contract, authenticated WebSocket delivery, subsequent
SSE support using the same contract, delivery to every connected tab/device,
cursor reconciliation, reconnect-summary behavior, and bounded slow-client
handling. NiceGUI shall adapt this contract rather than become the durable
messaging transport.

The validation environment shall contain multiple API/gateway and frontend
instances using the same PostgreSQL database, with clients attached through
different instances. Tests shall verify cross-instance delivery, all-tab/device
notification, no pre-commit event, no event after rollback, duplicate-event
idempotence, listener interruption, startup-race recovery, API/frontend
restart, bounded queues, slow-client isolation, and equivalent WebSocket/SSE
catch-up without NiceGUI-specific protocol assumptions.

The exit condition is that human messaging meets both durable and near-real-
time requirements across multiple instances, including recovery after every
connection gap.

### 16.4 Phase 4 — System notifications and administration

This phase shall implement the code-owned `SystemNotificationDefinition`
registry, database reconciliation and readiness checks, the internal Python
notification service, `required_for_business_commit`, immutable configuration
versions and translations, Notification Administration, reviewed/published
templates for every enabled language, controlled test sends, and system-only
Inbox access for users without person-to-person exchange privilege. There shall
be no production system-send REST endpoint, and system notifications shall
remain ineligible for record capture.

The validation gate shall verify registry consistency, required-producer
readiness failure, optional disablement, atomic business-change/notification
commit, rollback on enabled-notification failure, lowest security level, the
prohibition on receipts and actions, rejection of undeclared context or
audiences, complete published language coverage, immutable historic variants,
test marking and limits, and system-only Inbox behavior without exchange
privilege.

The exit condition is that approved backend features can emit localized,
durable system notifications without granting clients or administrators
arbitrary system-message authority.

### 16.5 Phase 5 — Records, retention, monitoring, and production hardening

This phase shall implement human-message-only record capture, deterministic
message PDFs, the final provenance PDF, embedded or subset-embedded Changa,
PDF/A-2u and PDF/UA-1 validation, atomic record/component/provenance commit,
expiry warnings, capture-gated and capture-free deletion rules, restoration
from Recently deleted, atomic whole-group purge without message tombstones,
draft cleanup, bounded multi-instance cleanup, the privilege-gated Monitor
page/API, operational metrics, and alerts.

The validation gate shall use independent PDF conformance tooling and visual
inspection of English and Arabic output. It shall verify embedded fonts,
Unicode extraction, tags, reading order, links, filenames, provenance agreement,
rollback at every capture boundary, record independence after message expiry,
non-rewriting of earlier captures after amendments, individual expiry and
deleted-entry restoration boundaries, branched-group retention, authorized
access to expired ancestors, concurrent atomic group purge, post-purge request
replay, capture/draft independence, configured capacity limits, and the complete
requirement-to-test traceability matrix.

The exit condition is that the subsystem satisfies its records-management,
retention, accessibility, security, scale, monitoring, and operational
requirements in addition to its messaging behavior.

### 16.6 Controls applying to every phase

Every phase shall:

- maintain requirement-to-implementation-to-test traceability and remain
  incomplete while an assigned requirement lacks evidence;
- use disposable databases for database-backed tests;
- keep `database/schema.sql` self-contained and repeat upgrade DDL in the
  migration without `psql` meta-commands;
- preserve frontend-neutral backend contracts and authoritative server-side
  authorization;
- reuse each frontend's established selector and table patterns;
- keep growing collections server-paginated or bounded by remote search;
- treat real-time events only as hints to durable state; and
- keep unfinished later-phase behavior inaccessible rather than presenting it
  as complete.

## 17. Resolved design decisions

The following decisions are requirements. Their detailed rules appear in the
referenced sections:

- section 11.5 defines configurable selector, recipient, resource-link, draft,
  linked-message, and generated-PDF limits;
- section 7.0 defines a hybrid identifier policy: UUIDs are limited to
  externally referenced messaging domain objects, while internal rows retain
  Wathiq's established `BIGSERIAL`, `BIGINT`, text, or composite-key
  conventions;
- MSG-004 and MSG-005 exclude self-addressing and inactive or suspended users;
- MSG-005A requires each frontend's messaging user, role, organizational-unit,
  and security-level controls to reuse and, where necessary, generically extend
  the corresponding selectors already established in that frontend rather than
  creating messaging-specific implementations;
- MSG-020 and sections 11.4–11.5 define three-year sent-message retention,
  capture-gated early deletion, expiry warnings, deleted-message restoration
  periods, whole-group purge without message tombstones, independent records
  and request-deduplication receipts, and preservation of required history after user
  deletion;
- section 6.5 sends live toasts to every connected tab/device and collapses all
  reconnect discoveries into at most one summary;
- MSG-018 prohibits system-message read receipts and action-required state;
- section 9.1 makes WebSocket the first transport and SSE the subsequent
  fallback using the same frontend-neutral event contract;
- MSG-016 defines draft expiry, the deleted-draft restoration period, and purge;
- MSG-017 permits only human-authored message chains to be captured, using
  bounded PDF/A-2u and PDF/UA-1 output, the specified safe filename convention,
  and a matching human-readable provenance PDF as the final digital component;
- features register immutable system-producer safety contracts, while
  privileged administrators manage versioned templates, audiences, priority,
  enablement, resource presentation, and operational ownership through
  Notification Administration, including bounded and unmistakably marked
  end-to-end test sends; and
- `system_notification_producers.required_for_business_commit` states whether
  a producer may be disabled and whether its registered event is forbidden from
  committing without durable notification creation; it does not express
  priority, acknowledgment, action, reading, or live-delivery semantics;
- system templates require published coverage for every enabled language and
  sends store immutable rendered language variants under MSG-021;
- `messaging.user_messages.exchange` controls person-to-person sending,
  receiving, Compose, Outbox, Drafts, replies, forwards, and follow-ups without
  restricting
  system-message Inbox delivery;
- MSG-023 preserves the immutable original while permitting only append-only,
  fairness-constrained due-date correction or action withdrawal, with an
  atomic specialized notice to the original audience;
- MSG-007 and MSG-008 permit Outbox forwarding and explicitly named follow-ups
  through an immutable envelope relationship without copying content or
  recipients; and
- system notification envelopes are created atomically with their causing
  business changes. This revision has no notification-intent queue, retry
  worker, manual intent retry, or intent-retention policy.

## 18. Architecture conclusion

NiceGUI is suitable for Wathiq's current near-real-time presentation. Its
established Socket.IO/WebSocket connection lets a NiceGUI adapter update a
connected page and show a toast without repeated mailbox polling. NiceGUI is
not, however, the messaging transport or the durable inter-user message queue.

The reliable and scalable design is frontend-neutral and PostgreSQL-based.
PostgreSQL atomically stores envelopes, mailbox sequences, recipient copies,
and read state. The same transaction issues `NOTIFY`, which PostgreSQL releases
after commit to every listening API gateway instance. Each gateway pushes the
availability hint to the authenticated connections it owns. NiceGUI, Flutter,
and future clients adapt the same versioned event contract to their own in-app
presentation and reconcile from the REST API after every connection gap.

This lets API and frontend instances scale horizontally without shared process
memory, sticky routing between users, or a dependency on a particular UI
framework. Correctness remains anchored in the database and catch-up API.

### Producer display names (approved 3 October 2026)

Registered producers have a canonical English `name` and localized names in the
same `translations` object used by other named Wathiq entities. These display
values are separate from stable producer codes, event contracts, and notification
subject/body templates. Built-in names are supplied by their feature catalogue
seed; rerunning it must preserve existing localized wording.

Notification Administration lists, detail headings, configuration/test dialogs,
and Monitor display the name in the viewer's effective language, with the shared
regional-language and canonical-English fallback. Legacy producers without a
name retain their code as a final fallback. The stable code remains secondary
information in the administration detail view and remains the API identifier.
Producer search matches the effective localized name, canonical English name,
and code without replacing server-side pagination or its stable code cursor.
No new entity-name editing workflow or UI terminology keys are introduced.


### Resource-selection revision (approved 3 October 2026)

The approved dialog and record/aggregation-only link rules are specified in
MSG-011, the compose requirements in section 6, sections 7.7–7.8 and 10.1, and
AC-MSG-008F–008I. There are no existing human-message links to preserve. This
revision supersedes direct component selection and the separate resource-kind,
resource dropdown, and Add workflow. It does not change capture-generated PDFs.

Implementation and requirement-to-test evidence for this revision are recorded
in [the resource-picker verification report](../docs/messaging-resource-picker.md).
The report covers dialog interaction, LTR/RTL browser inspection, authorized
full-text search, all-or-nothing insertion, component-target rejection, capture
preservation, and disposable-database schema/upgrade checks. Deployment requires
migration 040 and the normal catalogue synchronization/review workflow; those
persistent-database operations are separate from implementation verification.

### Message presentation revision (approved 3 October 2026)

Outbox list items show the selected To/Cc recipient names rather than the
sender's own name. Keep them on one line and truncate overflow with an ellipsis;
make the full list available in a tooltip and message details. Inbox continues
to show the sender. Sender and recipient user/role/unit display names use the
viewer's effective language and shared language fallback. Resolve existing
translations for these identities in bounded batches; fall back to the stored
send-time name when translation or the live identity is unavailable. Do not
rewrite immutable send-time snapshots. Restricted messages disclose no names.

Display message security as code, localized name and numeric level. Compose
and read views show resources in a distinct bounded panel below the authored
body, with type icons and consistent title/remove alignment. Internal storage
markers do not appear in the editor or message body. Existing messages retain
their stored content and links; no data migration is required.


### Addressing and mailbox filters revision (approved 3 October 2026)

The 4 October 2026 revision adds a primary Sender filter to Inbox and a
Recipient filter to Drafts. Inbox Sender selects a user through bounded remote
directory search or the shared browser in user-selection mode. It matches the
envelope's actual `sender_user_id`, not the sender's current roles or unit.
It does not match system producers, which are not human senders. Inbox retains
its separate Recipient filter. Outbox and Drafts need no Sender filter because
they contain only the authenticated person's sent envelopes or owned drafts.
Their primary person-related filter is Recipient.

Draft Recipient matches the current saved draft's To/Cc selector type and ID,
without expanding current membership. Use `recipient_kind` and `recipient_id`
as a required pair on the Drafts API too. All filters remain server-side,
paginated, subject to ownership/visibility and current clearance, and clearable.
Search and browsing preserve the selected entity. Browse appears below its
corresponding field. Draft Recipient is available in active and recently deleted
draft listings. Sender is available on the active Inbox listing.

Inbox and Outbox provide a single Recipient filter that searches users, roles
and organizational units together after two characters, using the same
localized names, descriptions, codes and user email matching as Compose.
There is no separate recipient-kind dropdown. Each result identifies its type.
A Browse organization structure button opens the existing bounded shared
browser, allowing selection of a unit, role or user. Place this button directly
below the Recipient field in both reading directions. Selection remains visible
until changed or cleared. Applying Search resets pagination and requests a
fresh server-filtered page; browsing itself does not load a mailbox page.

Inbox and Outbox also provide **Sent on or after** and **Sent before** date
filters. Both filter the envelope's sent timestamp on the server: Sent on or
after includes midnight
UTC on the selected date; Sent before excludes midnight UTC on its selected
date. Either bound may be omitted. Applying Search resets pagination while
retaining the selected recipient and other filter values.

The filter matches the original envelope's To/Cc selectors of the chosen type
and ID. It does not expand a role or unit again using current membership. The
API accepts the paired `recipient_kind` and `recipient_id` parameters on Inbox
and Outbox and rejects an incomplete pair. Filtering protected selector
headers requires current message clearance and retains normal mailbox
ownership/visibility rules. The selector search/browser keeps the existing
exchange-privilege gate.

Searching the directory finds a selectable entity; applying the selected entity
filters messages. Search and browsing have identical message-matching semantics.
For example, selecting Audit Office finds messages explicitly addressed to that
unit in To or Cc, not messages addressed individually to its current staff.
Selecting Auditor finds messages addressed to that role, not all messages sent
to its members. Selecting a user finds messages explicitly addressed to that
user, not every message delivered to them through a role, unit or Everyone.

This preserves the sender's original addressing intent and makes historical
results independent of later membership changes. The combined Recipient field
avoids requiring users to choose an entity type before finding a recipient.
Keeping Browse below that field makes its relationship clear. Sent-date bounds
let users narrow a mailbox on the server without downloading its full history;
reusing the existing Outbox boundary convention keeps both mailboxes consistent.

Verification covers automatic Reply addressing; informational Cc state in
Inbox, Outbox receipts and completion enforcement; To-over-Cc precedence;
role/user/unit filter selection and clearing; and bounded queries with stale
response suppression in both English and Arabic.

Recipient lookup requests used by a mailbox filter carry `purpose=filter`.
They include the authenticated person and do not apply send-time recipient
eligibility: finding a past message is independent of sending a new one.
Compose keeps its default `purpose=compose`, excludes self, and retains all
existing eligibility rules. Both lookup purposes keep the existing active
directory and exchange-privilege rules.

### Mailbox reading panels (approved 4 October 2026)

Inbox and Outbox open a message when the user clicks anywhere on its listing
row, or activates the focused row with Enter or Space. There is no separate
Open control. Drafts use the same row activation and panel layout, opening the
selected draft’s existing compose controls in the adjacent panel rather than
a modal dialog. Keep the listing, filters and pagination visible beside the
message, preserving the current listing page when another message is opened.
The listing appears on the left in LTR and on the right in RTL. On narrow
screens, stack the listing above the message. The reading panel retains all
existing message views and permitted controls. Drafts retain save, send,
discard/restore and cancel controls; saving preserves the listing page.
Switching drafts abandons stale requests for the previously selected draft. Independent list and detail requests must discard stale responses
without abandoning the other panel.

### Inspecting earlier linked messages (approved 4 October 2026)

Opening an earlier linked message displays it in a dialog over the reading
pane, headed “Earlier linked message”, with its subject, sender, date, body,
resources and permitted controls. The selected latest message, mailbox page
and row selection remain unchanged behind the dialog. Close returns directly
to that latest message. Opening another earlier link uses the same dialog;
Back returns to the preceding linked message. Existing linked-access checks
continue to use the original root envelope. Closing the dialog or abandoning
its owning message invalidates pending dialog requests.

### Capture destination and presentation clarifications (4 October 2026)

The earlier-message dialog is 672 pixels wide, capped by the viewport
(20% wider than its previous rendered 560-pixel width). Linked resources use a consistent
row layout with a type icon and a wrapping title in a separate resources panel.

A capture draft starts with Digital medium, including before a destination is
selected. Its title is the selected message subject; Date originated is that
message’s sent instant, displayed in the working timezone. Security is the
highest level among the captured chain, never lower than any included message.

The record-creation destination selector is clearable. Search begins at two
characters and returns at most 25 results, filtered on the server before
pagination. Search and paged hierarchy browsing include only visible
aggregations where the user currently has record.create, aggregation.add_record
(or the existing governance authorization), and an effective role in the owning
organizational unit. Exclude aggregations closed directly or through an ancestor;
capture destinations must also accept digital records (Digital or Mixed medium).
Existing commit-time authorization, closure and medium checks remain mandatory.
The search API accepts record_creation and digital_only query filters; the
corresponding hierarchy branches use the same filters and bind cursors to them.
The shared component card labels its storage_backend value “Storage backend”;
it does not introduce a different storage model for message capture.

### Persistent notification checkpoint and Digital capture (4 October 2026)

The browser retains its last reconciled mailbox sequence across logout/login
for the same API and user. The checkpoint key is isolated by API URL and user
identity, never by the changing login token; it stores only the numeric sequence,
not message content or credentials. Reconciliation updates it after each bounded
page. It survives language changes and logout until browser storage is cleared.
No other account may reuse it. Browser storage failure retains the existing
durable REST reconciliation behavior and in-page sequence protection. A known
checkpoint for the current legacy session may initialize the new key. Previously
presented messages do not become new again merely because the user signs in.
The one-message summary uses singular wording.

Message capture’s Medium is fixed to Digital. The editor displays it read-only
and APIs reject changing a capture draft to Mixed, Physical or null; commit
independently enforces Digital. A Digital capture may be placed in a Digital or
Mixed aggregation. Ordinary record creation retains its existing medium choices.

### Show capture metadata while PDFs are prepared (4 October 2026)

Clicking Save Record opens Create Record immediately, before PDF conversion.
The dialog initially shows a loading placeholder while authorized capture
metadata is read. It then displays editable record metadata and a placeholder
for each message PDF in the selected chain. Each placeholder shows the message
subject, planned filename and a preparation/validation indicator. Medium remains
fixed to Digital. The initial security level is the highest in the authorized
chain, and Date Originated is the selected message's sent time.

`GET /api/v1/messages/{envelope_id}/capture-preview?root_id=...` returns
`title`, `date_originated`, `security_level_id`, `medium` and ordered
`components` containing `title` and `file_name`. It performs the same chain,
permission, clearance and size-of-chain checks as capture initialization. It
creates no draft, files or conversion job. Its result is a presentation snapshot;
the capture and commit operations independently recheck authorization and chain
state. The existing POST capture endpoint still atomically stages validated PDFs.

Users can edit metadata while conversion runs. Create Record remains disabled
until every message PDF has been generated, independently validated and loaded
into the component panel. Completion replaces placeholders without resetting
metadata the user has edited. A failure displays the error and keeps creation
disabled; the user can cancel and start again. Cancelling or leaving the messaging
workspace while preparation runs must not reopen the dialog when it finishes;
any resulting uncommitted draft is discarded. No record is created by this
background preparation. The provenance PDF continues to be generated during the
existing authoritative commit, together with revalidation of the message PDFs.

Verification: `test_capture_preparation.py` covers immediate dialog display,
editable metadata, disabled creation, completion, cancellation, abandonment and
failure. The Phase 5 API tests cover the non-mutating authorized preview and the
existing validated, atomic capture and commit behavior.

### Meaningful resource references in capture PDFs (4 October 2026)

For the selected message and every captured earlier linked message, an accessible
record reference shows its record number and title; an accessible aggregation
reference shows its aggregation number and title. These values are read at PDF
render time using the saving user's current view authorization and the existing
message-link clearance checks. HTML-sensitive characters are escaped. Commit
rechecks access and regenerates the PDFs, so access lost during preparation does
not disclose metadata in the committed capture. An unavailable target retains
only the safe stored kind/identifier and the existing unavailable indication;
its live number and title must not appear. Linked resource content is not copied.
The authorized resource-link read projection exposes `number` alongside `title`
only for available targets; unavailable targets expose neither field.

### Localized entity names in capture PDFs (4 October 2026)

All message PDFs in a capture, including earlier linked messages, use the
capture draft's saved language for sender names, To/Cc selector names (users,
roles and organizational units), and security-level names. The provenance PDF
and its persisted captured-by name use the same language for the capturing user.
Use the shared entity localization rules: the requested language, its base
language when applicable, then the original stored name when a translation is
missing or blank. For deleted sender/recipient entities, use the immutable name
stored with the message. Do not invent or automatically translate missing names.

Capture authorization and resource-link disclosure checks continue to apply.
Entity names identify the sender and explicitly selected recipients already
visible in the authorized message; localization must not enumerate role or unit
membership or expose additional recipients. At authoritative commit, resolve
translations again in the saved capture language and freeze them in the PDFs.
Later changes to names, translations or UI language never rewrite a committed
capture. Subjects, bodies, amendment reasons and linked record/aggregation titles
retain their authored wording. No new translation catalogue keys are required;
these are existing entity translations, not interface-message translations.

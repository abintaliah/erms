# Full-text search implementation traceability

**Specification:** `specs/full-text-search.md`, approved revision 0.25  
**Maintained from:** Phase 0  
**Current delivery state:** Phases 0–5 implemented and verified locally; production rollout execution is an environment operation

Approved specification revision 0.25 and migration 015 restore
`roles.is_system` for consistency with the built-in-profile discriminator. On
roles and profiles alike, `is_system` means implementation-owned, not System
Administrator.

This is the normative requirement-to-implementation-to-verification matrix
required by specification section 1.1. A passing test alone does not change a
row to `verified`; the cited behavior and evidence must satisfy the approved
requirement. `approved_deferred` may be used only with an explicit approved
specification revision in Notes.

## 1. Complete normative-section allocation

This inventory prevents requirements outside the acceptance-criteria table
from disappearing during phased delivery.

## 4. Approved deferrals and departures

There are no approved Phase 0 deferrals. Work explicitly assigned to Phases
1–5 is not a deferral. The invalid illustrative `to_regconfig(text)` call was
corrected in approved revision 0.22 to a portable PostgreSQL catalogue check;
this preserves rather than changes the requirement.

## 5. Phase 1 entry inventory

Phase 1 began only after this inventory was derived from the complete approved
specification. These rows are the Phase 1 completion contract; passing tests
without the cited implementation and bidirectional reconciliation is
insufficient.

| P1-11 — §§10.5 and 15: metadata search uses existing authorization-safe resource relations/functions before filtering, ranking, pagination or counts | 1 | Authorized metadata views | Unauthenticated non-disclosure SQL assertion | verified | DB filtering only |
| P1-12 — §15 Phase 1: update authorization operation inventory and service-account/authentication documentation | 1 | Database/deployment/authentication/operations docs | Documentation review | verified | Phase 2 scope explicit |
| P1-13 — §§1.1, 6.8, 15 and FTS-17/18: portable canonical/migration SQL parity on uniquely named disposable PostgreSQL 18 databases with reported cleanup | 1 | Canonical schema; migration 010 | PostgreSQL 18.6 schema dumps and cleanup record | verified | No persistent DB used |
